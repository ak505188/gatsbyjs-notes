# Osvald Single Story
Based on route/notes by Dalia & Alta. I made improvements to money / stone routing and improved the Warden Davids fight, but the core of the route is the same.

There is a lot of small variations/choices based on what resources you have. I will try my best to list them, but can't guarantee I'll cover all of them.

## Route
Start Osvald

### Chapter 1
