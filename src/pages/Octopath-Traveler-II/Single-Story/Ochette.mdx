Route is largely based on [Altabiscuits's notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aOEp6pfOeCLe7CkKNNZPuweGNtElooZw/) and Tachibana's route.

## Route
Start Ochette
Choose Akala.

King Iguana: Precise Shot, Akala x3, Capture
Provoke: Akala, Akala, Akala x2. Watch for Grape drop.

<Menu>

##### Monster
- Disable Auto Capture
- Prepare King Iguana

</Menu>

Go to Trade Shop

<Menu>

##### Trade
- Traveler's Bow, equip to Ochette

</Menu>

Can break Path battle with Axe. Recommend break
Can break Tomb battle with Precise Shot x2. Recommend Flee

Forced battle: Bow x2.

There is a chance you get a battle on both these walks. Recommend walking half of first part, and running 2nd part.

<Battle>

#### Dark Entity 2500HP 4S (Dagger,Axe,Thunder,Wind)

> Count crit bonus damage first 5 turns, might need to do variation based off damage. For counting, +10 for Attack hits and +30 for Precise Shot crits.

1. Ochette: Axe
2. Ochette: Axe
3. Ochette: Axe
4. Ochette: Axe
5. Ochette: Precise Shot x3
6. Ochette: Healing Grape / Jerky if no drop on Provoke

> If damage > +35, Defend and Axe x4 next turn, then Precise Shot x3. You can ignore this if you get Ochette 2nd this turn and 1st next turn. To be safe, might want to make the threshold -25 damage to cover an attack crit. You will probably want to replace the 1st 2 attacks in next phase with Thunderbird as well.

7. Ochette: Axe
8. Ochette: Axe x3
9. Ochette: Precise Shot x4

> If you had to do backup and got no bonus damage, you are roughly -70, and need 2 Thunderbirds (1 if you are -45)

10. Ochette: Axe **Dark Entity**
11. Ochette: Axe

> This can be moved to whenever it's needed.

12. Ochette: Healing Grape
13. Ochette: Axe

> If +105, can do Axe x2 into Beastly Claws x4
> Should be able to Akala unless you were negative damage (Precise Shot x3 variation)

14. Ochette: Axe
15. Ochette: [LP] Beastly Claws
16. Ochette: Precise Shot x3 / Akala x3 if enough damage

> ### Money Route
> Assuming you take all lowest income battles, you end up with an "extra" $9600.
You can then do HHB for the 3rd Ch3 fight, and you have $1600 left. You can also
use that money to HHG a battle before Ch3 incase you get ambushed, which leaves you
with $2600 extra. These numbers assume you don't use HHG on the 1st Ch3 battle.
Since you have a bit of extra money, you can afford to flee from 1/2 battles on this trip.
Note that you might need to use money for HHR.

Run from small battles, kill Borderfall/Montwise with Tera. If Throne is 2nd T1, can try to flee.
Soothe Guard.

#### Northern Montwise Pass
I recommend taking the night battles, that way only 1 battle requires HHR and night battles generally die a bit faster.
