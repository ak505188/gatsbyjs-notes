These notes are pretty rough, I recommend using [Xazu's Notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2Yp9Tka3wNgwvYY6atafllFEfi60zMziHxKjf-Ei3Y/edit#gid=284811223) if you want something more detailed. I don't think the routes match up exactly but should be fairly close.

## Route
Start Temenos

Pick **Shadow S**.
Coerce Vados, Holy Light x2

Pick **Light S**.
Run from Skeletons.

For safety, can heal if you got hit more than T1 hit from Vados. You will want to use a Plum, and replace Temenos's heal turn with Heal Wounds instead of Grape.

Pick **$5600**.
If no Caits/Puffs, can kill battle here. In that case, run whole screen. Else, walk after entering door. Killing the battle isn't recommended as it only gives about 30JP. Kill is Sweeping Cleave x3 (Day)

- Throne: Defend / Attack

##### Turn 2

</Battle>

> These can be done in either order. I think Stormhail 1st is generally better since it gives you a better idea of what money & JP you need. The primary reason to go Crackridge 1st is if you need to Steal the Shadow M in Stormhail and aren't LVL16 yet. Notes will assume Stormhail 1st.

<Battle>

#### Deputy Cubaryi 53500HP 5S (Spear,Axe,Staff)
> Someone will die here. If it's Throne, you can't Collect and will need backup money + good turn order
> No Cait/Puff route assumes you do HHV + HHG. Can also do HHB + HHB, will likely need to fill damage with Stones.

> There are various ways to win this fight. This will be an example script that assumes you have a Blusterbloom. I will go into various Kaldena variations and explanations in the addendum.

#### Kaldena 100000HP 8S (Spear,Staff,Ice,Wind)
##### Turn 1
- Temenos: Defend
- Osvald: HGB
- Castti: Defend
- Throne: Pom M Self

##### Turn 2
- Castti: [LP]Concoct Blusterbloom x4 + Sticky Flower
- Temenos: Attack x4
- Throne: [LP]HHB x4, HHB x3
- Osvald: Pom L Throne / M Stone / Defend and Pom if Throne is 1st T3

##### Turn 3
- Throne: HHV x4
- Castti: Concoct Forget-me-do + Blusterbloom
- Others: Throw Stones

</Battle>

### Addendum
#### Kaldena
There are a lot of ways to play this fight, based on turn orders and what she does. I will try to list out your options here, but I recommend reading this and just practicing the fight yourself. Kaldena appears scary, but the success rate is actually fairly high if played correctly.

First off, Kaldena will always do 2 attacks T1, an AoE dark that can blind, and a single target physical that takes 1BP off whoever it hits. Thanks to the blind from Temenos' Talent, the single target only has a 50% chance to hit. If she does it first and misses, you don't need to heal. Another thing to note is that thanks to Throne's Talent, Kaldena's 2nd action will always be last T1.

##### Sticky Flower
Sticky Flower is INCREDIBLY useful in this fight. It does 3 things:

1. It reduces Kaldena's speed, increasing the crit rate of Hired Help from 17% to 61.5%. This reduces the amount of stones you need on average greatly, and let's you kill without a L Stone most of the time.
2. It reduces her Evasion. This increases your parties accuracy to 100%, 50% if not blinded. Even if not blinded, Osvald and Temenos can still miss normally.
3. It moves her turns back T2. For every Sticky Flower used, it moves her turns back 1 slot T2. So if order is Kaldena > Kaldena > Osvald > Throne, if you Sticky Flower x2 you can skip Osvald Defending, as he'll end up 1st T2.

You generally want to have Sticky Flower active T1&T2, and ideally use HHB x7 T2 for the increased crit rate. You'll ideally combo it with Blusterblooms, but if you don't have any Sticky x3 + Forget-me-do is a viable opening. Castti isn't guaranteed to get hit before her turn T1, it's very nice if you can go into this fight with her LP filled.

##### Diffusing + Pom Leaf
If you don't have a Blusterbloom, you can opt into Stealing a Pom Leaf in Nameless Village inn and buying a Diffusing at the General Store. You can also Steal a Cleansing Leaf in Canalbrine along with the Sticky Flower in Canalbrine, or buy both a Cleansing Leaf and a Grape Leaf in Canalbrine General Store. The issue with buying them early is that they're often not needed if you get a Blusterbloom. If you do this strat, you need to save 3k to afford the Diffusing Serum. I recommend doing HHB Cubaryi and skipping the Jade Staff.

Ideally you have LP for the fight, and if Castti is before Kaldena blind Diffusing + Pom Leaf x3 is pretty good. It really shines if she's after the blind attack, since you can do Diffusing + Pom Leaf + Pom Leaf/Grape Leaf + Cleansing Leaf to remove the Blind and give people BP.
