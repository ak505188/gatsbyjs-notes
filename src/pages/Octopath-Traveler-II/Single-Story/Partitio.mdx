## Partitio Single Story (Inventorless Route)
Credit to [YTreds](https://www.twitch.tv/ytreds) for the initial inventorless route.
Also credit to fura for running it which led to me seeing it, and all the other runners / routers of this category (and solo Partitio), whose work this was built on top of.

If you want to follow along a video, [this](https://youtu.be/n4qgEImJ-b4) is my PB at the time of writing these notes. Note that the run was done with an older Garnet script, which used $30000 on the fight and mugged the old man in Cape Cold for money.

> There are a lot of different potential Thurston fights, I will try to cover more possible scenarios in the Addendum. Will list only basic ones here.

> 2 biggest goals in this fight are to get Partitio before the Steam Engine, and to break Thurston before his next turn. If you don't succeed, you will probably lose.

##### Turn 1
- **Agnea**: Stimulate x2 Partitio
- **Partitio**: HHB x3

Warp **Beasting Bay: Anchorage**, go to **Roque Island**.

### Roque Anchorage
Switch to Night at start of steps, kill night battle with **HHB x3**.
Walk rest in day.

### Roque Island (Partitio Ch.4)

Switch to night before entering Factory.

### Roque Factory
Kill battle with HHB x3. Take note of Partitio's JP (Want 1000). Switch back to day.

> Whether or not you have enough depends heavily on what battle you get here. There's a 30% chance to get a group of 2, in which case you will likely be short.

You will want to walk a lot of the 2nd Factory Screen to avoid battles.
Pick **$24500**. Travel Banter to reset steps.

<Battle>

> Note that you will likely die here, a lot. Bracelets help but still do not guarantee a win.

> An important mechanic for this fight is the "Repair Counter". As soon as you kill a part, every Steam Tank turn advances the repair counter by 1. Once the counter is at 5, he will start repairing the other parts of the train. This is actually good for us, as he won't be attacking you. With most fights, you won't be able to kill before repairs start, so you'll be taking advantage of repairs to setup the kill.

> The only threatening repair is the bottom one, which will use Drive Away. Drive Away goes through Sidestep, and removes a character from the fight. However, it will prioritize everyone else over Partitio, so you can Olive someone to tank it for you. The other 2 parts are harmless for their first action.

#### Steam Tank 70000HP [Spear, Bow, Shadow]

> We assume that at most only Partitio & Castti are alive going into turn 2, generally just Partitio.

##### Turn 1
- **Paritio**: If first LATENT HHV x4. If at end and dies to next hit, Sidestep x3
- **Agnea/Oswald/Castti**: Fire L
- If anyone else has a spare turn, can heal. If it's Castti, can Defend > Armor Corrosive x3

> Assuming only Partitio survived, and Partitio was first. Also assuming all parts are dead.
> This is more of a worst case fight, can speed this up if fight is good. Can also Olive L Castti at Counter 5 so she's very likely to get Armor Corrosive off. Downside is that with no Bracelets she can get single target crit and die.

##### Turn 2 (Counter: 2)
- Sidestep x3 (Latent HHV x4 if you did Sidestep 1st turn)

##### Turn 3 (Repair Counter: 3)
- Reinforcing Jam

##### Turn 4 (Counter: 4)
- Sidestep x3

##### Turn 5 (Counter: 5)
- Collect x4

##### Turn 6 (Repair 1)
- Olive Castti

##### Turn 7 (Repair 2)
- *If Castti gets a turn, AC x2 Tank, skip Ruffians part of script. Assuming she doesn't get a turn.*
- **Partitio**: HHR x4

##### Turn 8 (Repair 3)
- LATENT HHV x4

##### Turn 9
- HHV x3 / Defend and HHV x4 next turn.

> HHV x3 can fail sometimes. If short money, can also finish with HHB x4, but not sure how consistent it is.

</Battle>

Hire **Roque**, skip cutscenes, end timer at Credit Screen. GG!

## Addendum
### Caits and Puffs
These all assume you're not buying Bracelets. If anyone wants to work out the Bracelet differences and have me add them here, let me know.

Not listed below are the obvious changes that come from extra EXP / JP, such as guaranteeing Hang Tough and being less likely to die to random battles, etc.

#### Cait
There are 2 timings for this, before and after Osvald. If before, I'm not sure it's worth killing. But if you decide to, after Osvald you will want to warp Crackridge Harbor and purchase the Ice M there.

Assuming you get a Cait on the way to Tropu'hopu (and skip the next Tropu'hopu battle), here is what changes.

##### Changes
- Entreat all the stuff in Tropu'hopu right away.
- Can skip Magus Knife chest.
- Garnet: Agnea can't die anymore. Osvald still needs Bracelet, barely can't tank a Bite with Gorgeous Sari. Castti should be safe now.
- Garnet: Partitio will barely not refill full latent from Garnet Soulstone + Break. Unless he got latent from T1, will need to use a Lychee before Thurston.
- Thurston: Can probably teach Castti Hale & Hearty. Castti can tank 1 Wrench (maybe 2 if full HP?).
- If you picked up the Magus Knife and only used $30000 on Thurston, you should barely be able to skip the $24500 chest.

#### Puff
> Gives $1500, 500XP, 300JP

##### Changes
- Entreat all the stuff in Tropu'hopu right away.
- Can skip Magus Knife
- Can teach Boost Start + Hale & Hearty before Garnet
- Garnet: Agnea barely can't tank Bite still. Castti can tank it even without healing Hale & Hearty HP.

#### Cultured Cait
> Gives $10000, 1250XP, 400JP

##### Changes
- Can skip both Magus Knife & $7000 in Ch.2. In test save had $101700 after Garnet.
- Can teach Boost Start + Hale & Hearty before Garnet. No need to heal Castti.
- Garnet: Once again, Partitio won't fill Latent unless he gets 
- Garnet: Osvald can tank a Bite (unless 2.5% crit). So no need for Bracelet, can just go on Partitio. It doesn't change Latent thresholds for Partitio either, he will either get Latent or need a Lychee M regardless.
- You don't level off Garnet, so will need want to heal before Thurston. Maybe just heal Partitio & Castti? Don't know if Agnea can tank anything, might be close.

#### Queen Puff
> Gives $3000, 500XP, 750JP

##### Changes
- Can skip Magus Knife (barely).
- Can teach Boost Start + Hale & Hearty right after kill.
- Garnet: Damage ranges & Latent management are the same as normal puff.

#### Chubby Cait
> Gives $50000, 2000XP, 1000JP. Kill with HHV x3

##### Changes
- Can skip $24500 Chest.
- Don't know how much it helps on Train.

#### King Puff
> Gives $25000, 1000XP, 1500JP. Kill with ???

##### Changes
If killed with HHB x3 can skip $24500.

### Garnet
#### Elemental Barrage script
Here's an alternate script YTreds made. I choose not to use it because Elemental Barrage can hit the same element with every hit, so it's possible to just get Ice and fail the fight. But the odds are exceedingly low, so it's worth putting in here. Can maybe be used as a backup to Castti getting hit by a crit Bite.

Below is copy and pasted from discord :)

<Battle> 

My Elemental Barrage strat in Garnet battle is below.
Unless very bad luck Elemental Barrage, Garnet shields will be reduced to 3 or less.
If Castti Bite crit, to break Garnet.

##### Turn 1
- Partitio: Latent Collect X4
- Agnea: Defend or if Castti Bite crit, Ruinous Kick
- Oswald(HP+500): Elemental Barrage x2 (x1 if Castti Bite crit)
- Castti(Thief): Attack x2

##### Turn 2
- Agnea: If alive, heal(Healing Grape Bunch) or Ruinous Kick (or Attack)
- Partitio: Defend or Attack
- Oswald: Fireball or Elemental Barrage x1(or2) (or Attack)
- Castti: Armor Corrosive

##### Turn 3
- Partitio: HHB x4

If very good luck Elemental Barrage and good T2 order, break Garnet and Armor Corrosive > HHB x3 (however not refill latent power in the battle)

</Battle>

#### Osvald Death Script
If you decide to greed, and only Osvald dies T1 to Bite (before he gets his action), here's a backup. If it's after his action, can just have Agnea Ruinous Kick T2. Note that Partitio won't get to break to fill Latent.

<Battle>

#### Garnet 23000HP [Spear, Axe, Fire, Lightning]
##### Turn 1
- **Partitio**: LATENT Collect x4
- **Agnea**: Defend
- **Oswald**: Dead
- **Castti**: Attack

##### Turn 2
- **Agnea**: Ruinous Kick
- **Partitio**: Attack x2
- **Castti**: Defend

##### Turn 3
- **Castti**: Attack x4
- **Partitio**: Olive Osvald
- **Agnea**: Defend

##### Turn 4
- **Agnea**: Stimulate Osvald
- **Osvald**: Armor Corrosive
- **Partitio**: HHB x3

</Battle>

### Thurston
There are a lot of variations to this fight, so I want to go over some general kill patterns / scenarios.

#### General Thurston Kills
- HHB x4 (Break) > Armor Corrosive > HHB x3
- HHB x4 (Break) > Pom S > HHB x4
- Break > HHV x4
- Break > Armor Corrosive > HHB x4 (If no crits, can be short 400-800, try to finish with Poison Axe)
- No Break > AC > HHV x4 (No idea what this range is)

#### Scenarios
##### Thurston attacks & kills Oswald
If you also had Agnea Stimulate T1, you will need someone before Thurston T2 to win. Else, you can have Agnea Defend, Castti Defend, Ruinous Kick + Attack x3 to break, and Latent HHR x2 into HHB x4 next turn. Anyone else dying should be simpler to recover than Osvald dying.

##### Thurston Reinforces the Engine
T1 Partitio HHV x3, then you break, apply AC, and go for HHB x4

##### Engine gets a turn, does blind move
Can't trust Attacks to knock off shields anymore, so try to break with Partitio HHM x4 or HHB x4.

##### Thurston does Throw Wrench
Just die :)

##### Sticky Flower
In rare cases, you can use a Sticky Flower (drop from Tropu'hopu battles) conoct to either fix turn order, or guarantee(?) crits for Beastlings. Be mindful of when you use it though, as it only lasts one turn. If Castti has Latent can use that to get multiple casts in 1 turn.

#### Money
If you aren't buying Bracelets and you skip the $24500 chest, you are about 2.2k short for the 3rd Vets on Train (Assuming 1 Ruffians). Can probably skip the chest with a Cait.

### Steam Tank
The fight in the notes is the worst case / slow fight. But it can be sped up, and can even kill before repairs start. Here's an example fight.

<Battle>

#### Steam Tank
##### Turn 1
- **Partitio**: LATENT HHV x4
- **Agnea/Osvald**: Fire L
- **Castti**: Defend

##### Turn 2
- **Castti**: Armor Corrosive x3
- **Paritio**: Sidestep x3

##### Turn 3
- **Partitio**: Reinforcing Jam

##### Turn 4
- **Partitio**: Collect x4

##### Turn 5
- **Partitio**: Latent HHV x4

##### Turn 6
- **Partitio**: HHV x3

</Battle>
