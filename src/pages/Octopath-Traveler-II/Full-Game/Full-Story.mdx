This is a complete mess, all of my scribbles are below.

Maybe don't add Temenos right away, get Castii, and use her to put in Temenos?
Doesn't work, would need to go to tavern to start quest.

Maybe do Oswald 3 before Partitio 2? Then you can sell the Axe of Avarice somewhat conveniently.
Nighttime buffs + Axe of Avarice + Mighty Belt Catapult x3 clears crackridge battles LMAO

Gonna want buy Shadow L during Temenos 3, need it for Oswald 5/Hikari 2
There's also a Fire L (even better), and same guy sells Miracle Stone, if we want to do quest during Oswald/Partitio 1

Squeeze Throne 2 in here somewhere early, get Ice M and Sturdy Pickaxe

Temenos Ch3 Clears
Condor x3
Two-Handed Hatchling x3
Crawly Fledling probably want to break, 2x Bow or Staff.
Borderfall Buffs, x2

Can use Throne / Temenos 1 to fix formation after getting Champ Belt
Steal Reinforcing from elderly woman by sacred flame
Can get Evil Ward on Temenos now, perfect time to setup Merchant on Oswald, and give Axe of Avarice and Champ Belt to Temenos

After clearing stuff, had 18700 left
Temenos x3 actually clears bats in Oswald 5
If you want to skip a Beastlings on Harvey, need 2L1M for kill, or 1L if you use brain and apply corrosive for T5

Would really like to have some more money going in. Can make it work though, would need 2L 1 or 2M, Pom M, Guards

NPC by New Delsta Tavern is pretty cheap 25% more on sales

Totohaha Can go to Item Shop to sell stuff, then hire NPC in inn for 20% off purchases
Plan post Harvey should be:
Partitio/Oswald 1, hire NPC for sells
Gravell, swap Castii for Oswald, get Conqueror Blade, get Giants Club (clear battles with Guards)
Make trip to TotoHaha, go to Item Shop, sell Conqueror Blade, buy Olives / Grapes
Go to inn, get NPC for purchase discounts. Get ship.
Get Reinforcing Jam, 20k, EXP Augmentor

Menu, get 
Partitio: Full Power
Throne: Boost Start, Life in Shadows
Castii: Merchant

Equip EXP Augmentor, Giant's Club
Father 3T, although Castii will need to be revived. Maybe do some Castii chapters first?

Do Temenos 3 next?
Deputy Cubaryi 53500HP 5S Spear Bow Staff
2T, break + crit scope, Mystic Staff x4 + Beastlings x4. Not sure how to get Collect though

Plukk either Beastlings, or Guards x4 and Catapult x4

Invig L kid by Soulstone Lady
Trosseau Boost Start on Castii is really nice, maybe needed for best strat
Or conoct shadow ingredient


Hikari 3 battle + Hikari 2 battles doesnt give him enough for Boost BP, might want to do another chapter in here. Maybe Throne 3?

Probably gonna need to do Throne 3 Winterbloom and Temenos 3 Stormhail with Hikari, just because of chapter conflicts.

Routing save didnt get 20% off purchase NPC, so down 20k

Kazan Catapult x4 + HP Thief x4 kills. Can probably do less
Rai Mei 2T, Beastling x4, Hikari break, Crit Scope, Mystic Staff + HP Thief x4
Needs Fort nuts on Throne
Might want to do Partitio 3 or Throne 3 earlier, so you have dancer and some more JP
Throne is fairly close to Surpassing here

Mother
Partitio Latent Bow x4
Throne HP Thief
Temenos Spring Boots Throne
Throne Aebers
Temenos Sacred Shield x4 Agnea

Caldena Throne doesnt have enough SP for full strat
Needs an Invig M i think? Or Rev Jam, or some armor that gives SP. Or just skip Veil and revive Agnea. Or just fucking plum her with agnea lol, dead turn anyway. Just realized, turn order is an issue here without Latent. Might not be able to give Throne BP
Needs all Fort M besides Ku fort M to finish, with agnea doing Guard x3 too

Claude with no extra battles, Agnea Defend + Mercs + Shackle barely survives
Strat is Partitio Guards x4 Agnea Dagger x3 Throne HP Thief Temenos Crit Scope
Partitio Mercs Throne Aebers Agnea Defend Temenos Aelfrics Throne Shackle
Agnea Collect Attack to finish

Didn't put on Extra Experience until after Claude.
So Mother Kaldena Claude Agnea 2 no Extra EXP

Partitio 4
Throne Defend Agnea Donate BP x2 Throne Temenos Crit Scope Partitio Beastling x3
Throne Aebers Partitio Collect x4 Agnea Donate BP Throne Temenos Aelfrics, Aebers again

Apparently you can't warp out of Partitio 3
Should consider doing Partitio 3 before Hikari 4, so I can get Dancer shrine for Partitio
Guess Hikari segment would be something like
Throne 3 Mother
Hikari 3
Throne 3 Father
Hikari 4 (Get Surpassing here)
Partitio 3
Hikari 4

Did not have Fort M from Tropohoho yet

Ochette 3 Owl 3 Char (Some funky mechanics here, need to explore more)
Partitio Defend
Throne Attack x3

Partitio Bow x4
Ochette Pom L Throne
Throne AC

Throne Latent + Surprise Attack x3, Aebers (If later in turn order, might need some extra damage from guards.) --Going 2nd works-- nevermind had a crit
Rest Defend

T4 Leghold + Veil of Darkness, if someone dies revive them and do the other of these
T5 Leghold/Veil if not on already, defend give Throne BP, if Throne needs SP give her SP
T6 Aebers

Partitio/Oswald 2 Moneylender goes down to Guard x4

Ochette/Castii Joint Provoke, probably have to give Ochette Alpione's amulet. Akala x3, Tera
Boss fight Castii and Ochette Axe x3, Partitio Ruffian, Throne Aebers

One of the sidequest guys in Ku has a Fort S

No battle for Hikari / Agnea
Ochette Castii I swapped in Temenos
Grotesque Monster Axe Bow Ice Thunder 7S 120000HP
Gonna need to Crit Scope, double Aebers.
Ochette Precise Shot Castii Axe breaks

Arcanette 150000HP 8S Spear Axe Ice Thunder
Arcanette is probably 3 turn, Aebers is doing about 72k

Vide Phase 1 Sword Axe Staff Ice Light 200000HP, phase trigger on half HP

Phase 1
Ochette Beastly Howl x3
Partitio Latent Beastlings x4
Hikari Hienka, Pom L Partitio
Castii Defend

Castii Break
Partitio, Hikari HHV x4
Ochette Defend

Ochette Pom L Hikari
HHV x7
Leaves him with about 41k

Throne Swift Step
Oswald Lion Dance
Agnea Latent Crit Scope
Temenos Aelfrics
Aebers + HP Thief

Phase 2
Throne Latent, Forbidden Elixer, Aebers
Oswald, Temenos Defend
Agnea Latent Springy Boots

Throne Dagger x3
Oswald, Agnea Dagger x4
Temenos Aelfircs
Throne AC

Oswald Lion Dance
Agnea/Temenos Pom L/Red Apple, Plum
Throne Latent Reinforcing Jam, Aebers
Throne Aebers, HP Thief

If Throne is after Agnea/Temenos: 
Aebers, then Reinforcing
Losing 50STR on phase 1 seems fine
End up a bit short for phase 2, unless you have Lion Dance for 1st Aebers
3.5k short with LVL49 Throne 779ATK (BT Dagger) 258SPD

Quick Clost +65SPD sold in Roque Island Shop 24k
Acrobat's Mantle +40SPD 15200 Wellgrove Department Store
Beastling guarding door in Beastling Village has Fort S
Reinforcing Jam in Sai East from NPC dunno rate
Invig M east Sai
Elderly Man 2nd screen Timberlain far east has Crit L
Pom L on way to Wellgrove
Dazzling Tiara, Swift Shield both in Merry Hills Shop
31k total, Tiara is 55SPD and Swift Shield is 47SPD

Can buy 1 Less Fire & Thunder S, buy from Merchant in Canalbrine. Can afford 1 more M
Ice S Throne
Ice S Hikari
2 Battles on way to Flamechurch, 2M
Temenos 2 Fire S
Tropohoho Wind M
Clockbank Fire M?
Nothing 1st part of Partitio 2
West Canalbrine Bridge M
Conning Creek 1 M
Conning Creek 2 M?
Inventor 1M
Partitio 2 2M

Stone route simplified: Buy 2 in Partitio 2, buy 2 in Oswald 4
If both Conning Creek and Clockbank battle, run from Inventor Battle

Total so far: 2 Ice S 2 Fire S 8-10M total
Can buy 2 in Clockbank, 
Can run from Inventor, save 1M?

Should be good, if we get 2 extra battles run from Inventor
Think Oswald gets Apothecary

Dog needs Latent Partitio, Pom S
Partitio Spear x2, Latent, Collect, have someone Pom S, Guard x4

Temenos 2
Pick Slumber Sage, $5600
Vados
Partitio Attack Oswald Icewind Throne Defend Temenos Holy Light
Throne Attack x3, Partitio Guard x3
Drops Pom L

Teach Boost Start if you haven't already

Stenvar
Partitio: Wind L
Oswald: Pom M Partitio
Throne: Defend
Temenos: Defend

Throne, Temenos: Sword x3
Partitio: Collect x4

Partitio: Guards x3

Equip Axe of Avarice
Might as well do Throne 2 here?
Buy Sturdy Pickaxe

Crackridge Harbor: Catapult x2 doesn't kill all enemies during the day.

Temenos 3: Fire L guy doesn't seem to be on the way. Buy Shadow L instead?
Pick $9200
Picking Pom L + Walk is slightly unsafe

Menu:
Get Thunder M, Merchant
Oswald Extra EXP, Apoth
Throne Merchant Boost Start
Temenos Evil Ward if possible, Inventor.

Might be better to do it through Learn Skills Menu, so he keeps Axe
Still want it for Montwise walk, if no Evil Ward
Oh, guess that solves itself
Evil Ward looks tight, think I miss it if I don't kill a 2nd Conning Creek Battle
Maybe actually worth delaying Gravell here, so you can have Champ Belt for trip

Start Temenos/Throne 1, go to Montwise. Kill battle if no Evil Ward yet, run from 2nd
Oswald 4: Buy Light/Shadow M
Grieving Golem 620000HP 7S Spear,Staff,Wind,Light
Partitio Attack Throne Attack Oswald Defend Temenos Springy Boots
Temenos & Oswald break, Throne/Partitio Nothing
Temenos Crit Scope, Guards x4, Beastlings x4, M Stone

Looks like I'm short for Oswald 5 if I used all my Fire Ms. Probably best to just buy in Gravell.

Hikari 2
Give him First Step
Battle 1: Defend, Spear x3, M Stone
Battle 2: Ice M
Battle 3: Thunder L + Hachimongiri
Thinking about it, can do Aggressive Slash, Thunder M, M Stone
Battle 4: Shadow L, Light M
Should barely have just enough Ms if buying Wind M
Bandelam 20000HP Spear Dagger Axe Fire Light
Throne AC, rest break. T2 Guards x4

Yurinas gives 1000$ 1000EXP 150JP (Before Augmentor)
Make sure Throne has full Latent and Boost Start

Go back to Flamechurch, go to Tavern, swap Oswald
Optimize Temenos, give him Champ Belt
Steal Reinforcing Jam (80%)

Go to Gravell for Oswald 5
Buy Ms from lady

Menu
Temenos: Merchant, Boost Start, Inventor
Throne: Apothecary
Oswald: Merchant, Boost Start

Do need M for Mug 1 3, Guard can miss crit on 1 and 3 is just short

Did Guards for Oswald 4, had 31k after finishing. Can also buy 1 less L 1 less M if using Guards here

Revenant doesnt die to 4x Guards without complete break.
Let's just run 2nd screen?
Had 46k after clearing 2 battles with guards (and throwing away money on mug 4)
So money looks free. Should look into way to skip Cat quest.

Harvey 80000HP 10S Spear Axe Fire Ice Thunder
Partitio Donate BP Oswald
Oswald Fireball
Throne Icicle/Axe if elemental weakness revealed
Temenos Springy Boots self

Temenos Elemental Bottle x4
Partitio: Shadow L
Oswald: Donate BP Partitio
Throne: Defend

Throne: Armor Corrosive
Temenos: Crit Scope
Partitio: Guards x4
Oswald: Beastlings x4

Partitio: Collect x3
Oswald: Defend

Oswald: Beastlings x4

Oswald/Partitio 1
Hire woman by inn for 25% off sales

Get Scholar, Throne 2
Get Rusty Sword, Mug Fort L (Guards x4)


TP Gravell. Consider swapping JP Augmentor to Partitio before this, only part of run where Throne is not in party.
Swap Oswald for Castii, Throne
Mug Fort L
Bergomi Nighttime HHBx3

Should I just get Agnea & Castii here?
Maybe go Montwise > Stormhail first, that way you can kill one battle and get EM.
Don't seem to have room on Temenos for Extra Experience (Evil Ward, Boost Start, Step Ahead, EM)
Maybe give Extra EXP to Partitio. Also, how am I handling the party Shenanigans here?
Want to do Assassins with Agnea, want Castii for Soothe, want Throne in for Assasins, Want Temenos for Evil Ward

Dependencies:
Giants Club: Castii
Stormhail: Castii
Boat: Castii
Assasins: Agnea, Throne, Boat (EXP Augmentor)
Rest of story: Castii

I think Swap in Castii, tag stuff, swap Agnea, then swap back Castii?
Feels super jank.
Want to keep Temenos because Evil Ward. Best would be to remove Partitio.
Throne Ambush Stormhail is lvl30, seems very reasonable
Debt Collector is 30 too

Ok, Throne 2 get EM + Life in Shadows
For now, Partitio EM Temenos Extra Experience
TP Gravell, swap Castii, do stuff.
Want 1 night kill for 16
Get Agnea (replace Castii). Do Boat stuff, then Assasins stuff
Now just need to find good opportunity to swap Castii/Hikari back in
Maybe Winterbloom Tavern for Castii?
Wellgrove Tavern for Castii?

Agnea 2 needs lvl8, isnt good for swapping her out
If doing Agnea 2 now though, Nighttime Mystic Staff x4 kills PogChamp

Can start Throne 3M even though Throne 3F is in progress

In routing saves, cleared both Gravell battles, Merry Hills battle with Guards

Partitio 3 Guards clears Steam Engine
Partitio Latent Guards, Temenos nothing, Hikari and Throne Defend
Hikari Aggressive Slash x3 Throne Corrosive Temenos Mystic Staff x4 Partitio Defend
Partitio Collect Throne Guards x4

Got 10k in Hikari 3
Menu now, Hikari Merchant stuff Throne Armmaster

Cubaryi
Partitio Spear x3 Throne Spear Temenos Attack
Mystic Staff x4 Collect x4 Beastling x4

Thurston
Hikari Throne Defend Temenos Nothing Partitio Latent HHG x4
Hikari Aggresive Slash x3 Throne AC Temenos Mystic Staff x4 Partitio Defend
M1 Collect M2 HHGx4

Guy guarding Stormhail tunnel has Feather Shield, 100% Steal 26SPD
Might want to clear pre Stormhail screen, failed 2 escapes here. Also step count is rough, might be worth considering Challenge for the reset.

---- This is no longer relevent, doing Castii first
Kazan Catapult x3 + Guards x3 Clears
Rai Mei Beastling at start, Pom M Temenos, Mystic Staff x2 Clears

Ritsu kill with Guards and Beastlings is about 1k short
Ritsu T1 Throne Spear x3 Partitio Spear x3 Hikari Spear Temenos Crit Scope
T2 HH, Mystic Staff, Veil of Darkness

Mugen same but only has 6 Shields
If Guards about 5.5k short. Can chuck an L. Want to Collect anyway

Can't think of a good Enshrouded King fight that Collects, so probably best to just not collect.
Just grab Fire Starter in Southern Ku Sands, and sell af
----

Trosseau (Note that I only had 44k here)
Partitio Attack x3 Castii Attack Throne Defend Temenos Crit Scope
Throne Axe x4 Castii HHB x4 Temenos Mystic Staff x4 Partitio Latent HHB x4
Merchant Collect other Merchant Defend (puts you before cloud) Temenos Tap (needed for damage) Throne Veil of Darkness
Tap

Once using Aebers SP management starts becoming a thing.
Probably worth getting a Invig L, lets you get 3 Aebers.

Rai Mei
Partitio Beastling x4, Throne Nothing Temenos Hikari Defend
Hikari Collect, Temenos Attack x3, Aebers

Hikari 5 1st 2 Bosses T1 Break, Aelfrics Aebers. Throne Defends T1 to guarantee

Enshrouded King
Winnehilds, Partitio Latent Attack x4, Crit Scope, Hikari Defend
Hikari Sword x2 Partitio Lion Dance Throne AC Temenos Aelfrics Throne Aebers
Throne Rev Jam Self, or have someone heal her, dunno. Needs SP and BP. Partitio Beastling, Aebers again.
Through extra Guards on "Hikari", had 97k here

Didn't use my Fort nuts apparently... (Which means Lockpick probably would work)
Ritso needs Aebers + HP Thief, so can Veil of Darkness T1
Enshrouded King now dies to Aebers + 2 Max Boosted HP Thief, turn order dependant though.
2 Aebers doesn't seem to quite do it, would need to throw Hired Help

****************I didn't have BT Blade on this whole time...*****************

Kaldena does need Crit Scope
Should setup Agnea same time I give Throne BT Blade. Might be able to tank Kaldena hit if full HP
Setup is turn order based, want someone before Throne T2. Can backup with Throne Latent
Partitio Attack x4 Agnea Spear x3 Throne Spear x1 Temenos Crit Scope
Aebers, Donate BP/Pom L, Aelfrics, Aebers
Was hitting for 53k, so damage is close here. BT Dagger matters
Also sometimes needs Pom L (I used 1 here)

Veronica is a tiny bit short, 57300/60000. Probably just HP Thief T1.

Bought Speed Gear in Merry Hills
Dolcinaea 1 was 1 Aebers, 2 was Aebers + 17k
Father Crit Scope, Aebers + HP Thief/Aebers, No break required

Watch HP, make sure healthy going in. Maybe Stay at Inn
Claude I used Vets + Aebers, No Break fight.
Partitio, Throne Def, Agnea Mercs x2, Temenos Crit Scope
Aebers, HHV x4, Tap after his turn
Has to be HHV, Beastlings not enough. HHV is overkill, so weaker dagger would be fine.
Agnea got 35.5 here, so holy shit its still close. Still Partitio 4 left though

Partitio 4
Throne Defend Partitio Beastling x4 (3 is fine) Temenos Crit Scope
Throne Aebers Merchants Donate BP + Collect, Aelfrics + Aebers

Tera Crit Scope, Aebers. Tera's turn gets eaten on damage threshold, no need to do anything fancy.
Don't know how tight this is.

Probably want to wait to give Ochette stuff till after Glacis.
Might want to find an alternate timing to get EM on Temenos
Actually nevermind, want A First Step for Provoke for Glacis
Guy dies to 2 Stones. Ochette dies to 1 hit, need something for this.
Maybe just Nourish L her? lol
Also have an Invig M, not sure from where. Gotten after the Forts were used.
Even with Nourish L she dies to crit 0_0
After Tera segment has just enough JP for Boost Start

Aebers isnt enough for Glacis on its own, 10k HP left
Best solution is probably money (HHB x3)


Malamaowl isnt consistent, he needs to not do scarlet moon on unbreak. Trigger is random/unknown

Throne Dagger x3 Temenos Defend
Temenos Latent Attack x4 Throne Defend Ochette Pom L
Throne Latent Aebers, HP Thief Ochette Donate BP Throne
Throne AC rest Defend
All Defend
Surprise Attack

Ochette needs Nourish L to tank Hand thing in joint chapter. Need an L Stone for it too
Akala-Akala-Glacis-L Stone works
Or Alpione 1st

Partitio/Oswald 4
Swap to them in Gravell?
With Night buffs Guards clear 1st
2nd needs Beastlings

Yomi Vets is range

Order should probably be Ochette/Agnea (Beastling Tavern), Oswald/Partitio (Gravell Tavern)
Hikari/Agnea (Ryu), Hikari 2 Start, Throne / Temenos 2 start, Finish Hikari, Finish Temenos

Then Hikari/Agnea, Ochette/Castii (switch after battle)
Grotesque Monster: Need some way to hit a shield with Temenos, Aebers x2
Arcanette: Break T2, Aebers x2 + Some damage
Gravell next

Setup (Alpione), swap to phase 1 party, stay at inn. And go

Had 55k left after Phase 1
