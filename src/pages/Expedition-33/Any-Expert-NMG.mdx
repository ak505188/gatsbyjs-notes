# Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Expert Resricted Route
Last updated: 5/27/25

These are my personal notes for the category, the writing will reflect that. For the most part these notes will not say where to go or where things are, just what to do. I will be updating these as the route progresses, changes will be reflected in the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

There will also be enemy data and maybe some other useful information at the bottom of the notes.

If there's a time listed by a fight, it's my best time for it so far. It does not represent the average.

> - Glissandos: 2 Parries
> - Charm: 1 Parry, same timing as Glissando enchants. 2 Explosions > Parry
> - Seduce: Gradient
> - Grand Ballet: 5 Hits, watch ballets + audio cue. 1st one is earlier than you'd think, last one you have to be patient for.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Attack > Berserk Slash (Watch damage, if getting crits fail QTEs on other abilities to adjust)
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: Card Weaver > Twilight Slash

> If she goes frantic before her move, we did too much damage. Adjust with QTEs next time.

Parry Glissando's, she should go frantic

#### The Paintress 482157HP (4:32)  
> 173736XP, $8519, Painted Power + 3 Resplendent Chroma Catalyst
> Need >= 744 speed for Rush strat.

> - Void Meteors: 7 projectiles left to right. They kind of explode before launching, parry as soon as you see it.
> - Gradient Attack: 1 Gradient
> - Chroma Waves: 4 hits, 2nd one right after 1st. Audio cue works. Parry on start of cue.
> - Scatters Chroma: 5 hits, parry once the black waves go into the circle. No more waves around circle > parry.
> - Manipulates Rocks from the Monolith: 3 hit AoE, parry after the rock moves back?

Parry only the AoE moves, and you can dodge 1 to avoid the counter unless noted otherwise.
You want to slightly underdamage, so you can kill with the parry counter on her 4th move.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Shoot, Attack > Berserk Slash
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: Intervention Lune
- Lune: Lightning Dance

Dodge Meteors

##### Turn 1
- Verso: Leadership
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: All Set

Parry Gradient, Parry 3/4 Chroma Waves and dodge 1.

##### Turn 2
- Verso: Attack > Skip
- Lune: Lightning Dance
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

Parry all 5 chroma scatters, transition with counter.

#### Phase 2
> - Summons giant brush of light: 3 hit aoe, parry on swing. Has audio cue similar to Chroma Waves
> - Flies into the air: 5 hit, 2nd dodge on twirl, 3rd is slow, 4th is right after 3rd.
> - Tears reality apart: 5 projectiles, dodge / parry at their "arc". Randomly start from left or right.
> - Paintress unleashes: 7 single target into AoE
> - Attacks from afar: Jump into 3 parry. Patient for jump

You might not need all this damage, but you do need to keep doing stuff to generate Gradient

##### Turn 1
- Verso: Attack > Berserk Slash
- Lune: Wildfire
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

She will get 2 turns here. Giant brush > parry first 2 and perfect dodge 3rd.
Dodge all the moves of flies into the air. No perfect dodges required, just survive.

##### Turn 2
- Lune: Lightning Dance (She outspeeds because Rush wore off for the others, might depend on speed)
- Verso: Attack > Powerful
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

#### Phase 3 ~72323HP
