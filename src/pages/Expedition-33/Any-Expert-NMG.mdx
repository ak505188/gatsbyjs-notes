# Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Expert Restricted Route
This route is now updated to use the Lighterim instead of Deminerim. The Deminerim notes can be found [here](/Expedition-33/Any-Expert-NMG-Deminerim).

Last update: 6/24/25. Note that the changes here make the run more tedious, requiring not killing Abbests on Eveque and requiring a game restart every run that makes it to Meadows so the Bruler in Flying Waters jumps down. So for some runners, these changes might not be worth implementing. They do save ~20s though.
**Last big update: 6/19/25**: This is a big one, replaces Lighterim with Deminerim. Read the changelog!

**Patch update 6/10/25**: You can no longer interact with flags during dialogue.
Here are the affected areas to my current knowledge and potential fixes:
- Manor: After Picto menu, reload most recent autosave to cancel dialogue.
- Sirene: Use flag at camp, or before Glissando.

Lampmaster phase 1 4 lamp attack can now no longer be countered. This is actually good for us since we can now parry all 4 for more AP.

---

### Notation
For menus, I will sometimes have something in parenthesis. If it's (S1-3), it refers to the slot the Picto should be placed in. If it's a Playstation controller button, it's a button you should press to optimize the menu.

For battles, there will sometimes be something like (1.1 QTE). This refers to the Quick Time Action you do when you use an Ability. A perfect is 1.2, a normal is 1.1, and a fail is 1.0. The number refers to the damage multiplier the skill gets from the QTE.

---

You can check the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

These are my personal notes for the category, the writing will reflect that. For the most part these notes will not say where to go or where things are, just what to do. I will be updating these as the route progresses, changes will be reflected in the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

There will also be enemy data and maybe some other useful information at the bottom of the notes.

If there's a time listed by a fight, it's my best time for it so far. It does not represent the average.

## Prologue

<Menu>

#### Maelle 450HP (0:24-0:27)
> 1XP, $50, Colour of Lumina

Option 1: Attack > Parry > Overcharge > Parry > Attack (0:24 w/crit, 0:27 without)
Option 2: Attack > Parry > Attack > Dodge, Overcharge (0:26). If you get hit instead of dodging add 1 shot.

On average, optimal choice is probably to go for Option 2 if you don't get the parry crit T1.
If you crit an attack with Option 2, you can save 1s by intentionally getting hit by 1 of Maelle's 3 hits.

In phase 1, you need to counter 1 or 2 attacks. Need about 1500 damage of extra counter damage, assuming Immolation crit. It's better to counter on the 2nd turn, since you will have Exposing applied. But any counter that isn't Gustave target is good enough 1st attack.

> Threshold between him getting 2 attacks before you is somewhere between 328 and 318 speed.

Good or bad fight depends on targetting, bad fight loses ~30s.
1st phase you need Sciel or Verso. 2nd phase you NEED Verso target at the start. If you don't get the right moves turn 1, you can refer to mediocre fight below.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Berserk Slash

> Note that if you hit all crits and he targets Verso with the jump attack move, you can kill off the first Berserk Slash.
> If that happens, you Immolation T1. After the transition, Intervention > Berserk Slash, and next turn Lune Tint Sciel, Berserk Slash > Intervention > Berserk Slash. You don't need to counter his moves in phase 2.

##### Turn 1
- Lune: Energy Tint Verso / Immolation
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Intervention Verso
- Verso: Defiant Strike / Berserk Slash

Phase transitions here. **Notation is good / bad fight**. Good fight is ONLY if Verso is targeted on his 1st attack.
If good fight, parry everything. If not, dodge everything, you want to do less than half his HP on this turn.

##### Turn 2
- Lune: Attack or Tint Sciel / Skip
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Intervention Verso > Berserk Slash / Tint if needed, else nothing

Good fight kills here.

##### Turn 3
- Lune: Attack
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Intervention Verso
- Verso: Berserk Slash

> This is an alternate strat, that can't get as good of a time, but is also faster than the above in bad cases. I recommend this variant if you get Lune target or AoE for Dualliste's 1st attack.
> Note that for this script to work, Sciel needs to get 1AP outside of scripted Dualliste hits.

#### Mediocre Fight (2:05)
##### Turn 1
- Lune: Tint Verso
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Tint Verso

> If you can transition with a parry, go for it.

##### Turn 2
- Lune: Ice Lance
- Verso: Berserk Slash / Defiant Strike

Phase change. Don't counter him this phase with this fight version, unless you transitioned off a parry and it's Verso target. In that case, play like the good fight 2nd phase.

#### Glissando 350757HP (0:59)
> 51897XP, $2820, 1 Resplendent Chroma Catalyst
> 515 speed seems to be the cutoff for him to not get 2 moves in T1.

> - Enchants its target: 1 hit. 2 explosions > Parry. Use rhythm.

> - Smashes its tail: 3 Parry, need to find cue. 1st visual on slowdown, 2nd audio, 3rd delayed audio.
> - Summons ballets: 3 jumps, easy.
> - Attacks with her fabric: one on each character, not sure on timing cue yet.

> You can skip Verso Attack here, but will potentially need extra damage T1. Only do it if you're comfortable here.

##### Turn 0

#### Sirene 303990HP (1:08)

> - Glissandos: 2 Parries
> - Charm: 1 Parry, same timing as Glissando enchants. 2 Explosions > Parry
> - Seduce: Gradient
> - Grand Ballet: 5 Hits, watch ballets + audio cue. 1st one is earlier than you'd think, last one you have to be patient for.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Attack > Berserk Slash
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: Card Weaver > Twilight Slash

> If she goes frantic before her move, we did too much damage. Adjust with QTEs next time.

> 173736XP, $8520, Second Chance + 3 Resplendent Chroma Catalyst
> 724 Speed is the cutoff here. 732 doesn't work.

> - Attempts to Vanish: 2 hit, Parry into Gradient. Parry right before he hits black orb. Gradient when back turned.

> - Attacks from a distance: 4 attacks, 1st 3 parry on slow down. 4th is ground pound.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Attack > 1 Shot, Leadership
- Lune: Storm Caller
- Sciel: Focused Fortell

Dodge here if possible.

##### Turn 1
- Verso: Attack > Powerful
- Sciel: Sealed Fate
- Lune: Ice Lance

If no counter T1, I recommend countering here. It's not necessary, but damage is VERY tight without it.

##### Turn 2
- Verso: Attack > Shots, Berserk Slash / Defiant Strike / Attack. You need to control damage here to get him as close to half as possible.
- Sciel: Shoot until 2 AP, Gradient > Sealed Fate

This should kill, if not get fucked.

#### The Paintress 482157HP (4:09)  
> 173736XP, $8519, Painted Power + 3 Resplendent Chroma Catalyst
> Need >= 744 speed for Rush strat.

> - Void Meteors: 7 projectiles left to right. They kind of explode before launching, parry as soon as you see it.
> - Gradient Attack: 1 Gradient
> - Chroma Waves: 4 hits, 2nd one right after 1st. Audio cue works. Parry on start of cue.
> - Scatters Chroma: 5 hits, parry once the black waves go into the circle. No more waves around circle > parry.
> - Manipulates Rocks from the Monolith: 3 hit AoE, parry after the rock moves back?

Parry only the AoE moves, and you can dodge 1 to avoid the counter unless noted otherwise.
You want to slightly underdamage, so you can kill with the parry counter on her 4th move.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Skip
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: Intervention Lune
- Lune: Lightning Dance

Dodge Meteors

##### Turn 1
- Verso: (Shoot and/or Attack for Rank C), Leadership
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: All Set

Parry Gradient, Parry Chroma Waves and counter.

##### Turn 2
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Lune: Lightning Dance
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate (Don't fail QTE)

Parry all 5 chroma scatters, transition with counter.

#### Phase 2
> - Summons giant brush of light: 3 hit aoe, parry on swing. Has audio cue similar to Chroma Waves
> - Flies into the air: 5 hit, 2nd dodge on twirl, 3rd is slow, 4th is right after 3rd.
> - Tears reality apart: 5 projectiles, dodge / parry at their "arc". Randomly start from left or right.
> - Paintress unleashes: 7 single target into AoE
> - Attacks from afar: Jump into 3 parry. Patient for jump

You might not need all this damage, but you do need to keep doing stuff to generate Gradient

##### Turn 1
- Verso: Attack > Berserk Slash
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

She will get 2 turns here. Giant brush > parry first 2 and perfect dodge 3rd.
Dodge all the moves of flies into the air. No perfect dodges required, just survive.

##### Turn 2
- Lune: Lightning Dance (She outspeeds because Rush wore off for the others, might depend on speed)
- Verso: Attack > Powerful
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

#### Phase 3 ~72323HP
Notation is Verso not healed / Verso healed. Verso not healed is ~2s faster.

##### Turn 1
- Lune: Skip / Attack

## Scribbles
Sciel needs 18 Luck, can hold off on some of it till Renoir 2 if I want to invest more might.
At LVL30, she will need 3 Agility 18 Luck to have EXACTLY enough for Paintress.
Verso doesn't need to be the fastest for Paintress with Auto Rush (even though we're rushing ourselves). No idea why.

Grim Harvest doesn't work on Faketress. Harvest does, but doesn't consume Foretell.

Can probably delay Maelle might investment till Old Lumiere. Should hit just around the the threshold with marking shot and verso might investment.

Looks like Sciel doesn't need any might to kill Gault with Phantom Blade

Renoir 3 Setup: Don't touch Verso, give Sciel Weakness Gain and Auto Rush Lumina
