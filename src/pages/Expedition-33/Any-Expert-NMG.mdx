# Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Expert Resricted Route
Last updated: 5/24/25

These are my personal notes for the category, the writing will reflect that. For the most part these notes will not say where to go or where things are, just what to do. I will be updating these as the route progresses, changes will be reflected in the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

There will also be enemy data and maybe some other useful information at the bottom of the notes.

If there's a time listed by a fight, it's my best time for it so far. It does not represent the average.

> Threshold between him getting 2 attacks before you is somewhere between 328 and 318 speed.

Good or bad fight depends on targetting, bad fight loses ~30s.
1st phase you want AoE or anyone but Lune target. 2nd phase you NEED Verso target at the start.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Berserk Slash

> Note that if you hit all crits and he targets Verso with the jump attack move, you can kill off the first Berserk Slash.
> If that happens, I think you Energy Tint Sciel T1, on transition Intervention > Berserk Slash, and next turn standard Berserk Slash > Intervention.

##### Turn 1
- Lune: Energy Tint Verso if Sciel/Lune target or AoE, Sciel if Verso target.
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Intervention Verso
- Verso: Defiant Strike / Berserk Slash

Phase transitions here. **Notation is good / bad fight**. Good fight is ONLY if Verso is targeted on his 1st attack.
If good fight, parry everything. If not, dodge everything, you want to do less than half his HP on this turn.

#### Renoir 370000HP (1:26)
> 173736XP, $8520, Second Chance + 3 Resplendent Chroma Catalyst
> 724 Speed seems to be the cutoff here.

> - Attempts to Vanish: 2 hit, Parry into Gradient. Parry right before he hits black orb. Gradient when back turned.
> - Melee Combo: 6 hit, gradient last?
> - Incredible amount of chroma: 2 Parries, Gradient. Parry as soon as you see the ball shrink.
> - Waves of Chroma: 5 Parry, last is delayed
> - Attacks from a distance: 4 attacks, 1st 3 parry on slow down. 4th is ground pound.

Dodge whatever attacks you can, don't want counter animations.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: 1 Shot, Attack > Leadership
- Lune: Storm Caller
- Sciel: Focused Fortell

##### Turn 1
- Verso: Attack > Powerful
- Sciel: Sealed Fate
- Lune: Icicle Push

##### Turn 2
- Verso: Attack > Shots, Berserk Slash / Defiant Strike / Attack. You need to control damage here to get him as close to half as possible.

#### The Paintress >473188HP (475000?) (4:36)  
> 173736XP, $8519, Painted Power + 3 Resplendent Chroma Catalyst
> Need >= 744 speed for Rush strat.

> - Void Meteors: 7 projectiles left to right. They kind of explode before launching, parry as soon as you see it.
> - Gradient Attack: 1 Gradient
> - Chroma Waves: 4 hits, 2nd one right after 1st. Audio cue works. Parry on start of cue.
> - Scatters Chroma: 5 hits, parry once the black waves go into the circle. No more waves around circle > parry.
> - Manipulates Rocks from the Monolith: 3 hit AoE, parry after the rock moves back?

Parry only the AoE moves, and you can dodge 1 to avoid the counter unless noted otherwise.
You want to slightly underdamage, so you can kill with the parry counter on her 4th move.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Shoot, Attack > Berserk Slash
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: Intervention Lune
- Lune: Lightning Dance

Dodge Meteors

##### Turn 1
- Verso: Leadership
- Lune: Elemental Trick
- Sciel: All Set

Parry Gradient, Parry 3/4 Chroma Waves and dodge 1.

##### Turn 2
- Verso: Attack > Skip
- Lune: Lightning Dance
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

Parry all 5 chroma scatters, transition with counter.

#### Phase 2
> - Summons giant brush of light: 3 hit aoe, parry on swing. Has audio cue similar to Chroma Waves
> - Flies into the air: 5 hit, 2nd dodge on twirl, 3rd is slow, 4th is right after 3rd.
> - Tears reality apart: 5 projectiles, dodge / parry at their "arc". Randomly start from left or right.
> - Paintress unleashes: 7 single target into AoE
> - Attacks from afar: Jump into 3 parry. Patient for jump

You might not need all this damage, but you do need to keep doing stuff to generate Gradient

##### Turn 1
- Verso: Attack > Berserk Slash
- Lune: Wildfire
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

She will get 2 turns here. Giant brush > parry first 2 and perfect dodge 3rd.
Dodge all the moves of flies into the air. No perfect dodges required, just survive.

##### Turn 2
- Lune: Lightning Dance (She outspeeds because Rush wore off for the others, might depend on speed)
- Verso: Attack > Powerful
- Sciel: Gradient > Sealed Fate

#### Phase 3 70000HP?
Just do the best damage of whoever doesn't get healed. Sciel has Confident Fighter so she'll always be fine here.
Need 2 character's damage.

##### Turn 1
- Lune: Skip
- Verso: Attack > Skip
- Sciel: Sealed Fate
