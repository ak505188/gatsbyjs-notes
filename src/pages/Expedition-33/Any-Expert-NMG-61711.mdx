# Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Expert Glitchless Route

Last update: 1/24/26.

This is the route for patches 61xxx and hopefully on. The really big changes were the removal of the hidden 10% damage boosts on Dead Energy II, First Strike, and Medalum. As a result, this route is significantly slower. And as of right now, it also has some pretty bad input delay issues. So if you are on PC and can downpatch, I recommend doing so.

But if you can't, you're at the right place :)

---

### Notation
For menus, I will sometimes have something in parenthesis. If it's (S1-3), it refers to the slot the Picto should be placed in. If it's a Playstation controller button, it's a button you should press to optimize the menu.

For battles, there will sometimes be something like (1.1 QTE). This refers to the Quick Time Action you do when you use an Ability. A perfect is 1.2, a normal is 1.1, and a fail is 1.0. The number refers to the damage multiplier the skill gets from the QTE.

Cutscene menu: you can open a menu right before you enter a cutscene transition, which will give you about 3s of menu time before the cutscene plays. You can use this to squeeze in menus and reduce wasted time. Menus will be labeled with which cutscenes they can be done during. Note that this seperates the menus, so if you're not doing cutscene menus you will want to combine them into one menu.

---

You can check the changelog at the bottom of the notes. This changelog will be restarted for this patch, so to check older stuff refer to the older patch notes.

These are my personal notes for the category, the writing will reflect that. For the most part these notes will not say where to go or where things are, just what to do. I will be updating these as the route progresses, changes will be reflected in the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

There will also be enemy data and maybe some other useful information at the bottom of the notes.

If there's a time listed by a fight, it's my best time for it so far. It does not represent the average.

## Prologue

<Battle>

#### Maelle 450HP (0:24-0:27)
> 1XP, $50, Colour of Lumina

Option 1: Attack > Parry > Overcharge > Parry > Attack (0:24 w/crit, 0:27 without)
Option 2: Attack > Parry > Attack > Dodge, Overcharge (0:26). If you get hit instead of dodging add 1 shot.

On average, optimal choice is probably to go for Option 2 if you don't get the parry crit T1.
If you crit an attack with Option 2, you can save 1s by intentionally getting hit by 1 of Maelle's 3 hits.

You want to counter all his attacks unless you got an AoE counter T1, then you can possibly skip the second.
On this patch the damage is WAY tighter, you need to get his HP as close to half as possible with Verso. There's a lot less wiggle room now.

## Bonus Strats

<Menu>

#### Fast Dualliste 71106HP (1:40/2:15)
Good or bad fight depends on targetting, bad fight loses ~30s.
1st phase you really want Sciel or Verso target. 2nd phase you NEED Verso target at the start.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Berserk Slash

##### Turn 1
- Lune: Immolation if Verso Target / Energy Tint Verso
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Intervention Verso
- Verso: Defiant Strike / Berserk Slash

If good fight, parry everything. If not, dodge everything, you want to do less than half his HP on this turn.

##### Turn 2
- Lune: Tint Sciel if under 5AP or Attack or Immolation / Skip
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Intervention Verso > Berserk Slash / Tint if needed, else nothing

## Routing Ideas to Explore
Could be worth it to pick up Staggering Attack in Flying Waters and use that for Gustave speed. You would then be able to dump quite a bit more into Might before Goblu. I think you'd need 2 Agi at first flag, and 1 more Agi somewhere later.
I opted out of this because fast Goblu seems like a dream anyway and I didn't like what it did to the menus. If doing this, leave Dodger on Gustave until after you get Staggering Attack.

Upgrading Bruleram to LVL4 might be worth it, would guarantee fast Petank, gets you better Sakapatates and better tournament. The downside is with no drops you wouldn't be able to get Medalum LV6 before Francois. And it takes a seperate Curator trip to upgrade Bruleram.

Even though we need an extra battle with First Strike, it might still be better to take the Lanceram LV6 fight over Delaram.

Instead of killing the Rocher, there's a group right by First Strike that can be cleared in 16s with Medalum LV6. That group drops more XP, money, and a Chation LV7 which might be very useful for Axons. Script is Marking Shot, Wildfire self, Maelle shoots fliers 4 times each, Percee.

Might be worth exploring other kill setups for the Chalier in Forgotten Battlefield, simply so we can get 1 more point on First Strike. Something like First Strike Maelle RoF opening or something. Don't think it's good though (and crits can screw you?).

We can give Verso First Strike before Monoco. The menu just felt clunky to me, and I think it would be about the same speed. You would just Powerful & Intervention T1, and Attack > Tint T2.

We can invest more Might into Verso in Old Lumiere, I just don't see enough of a benefit.

Could still be worth getting Auto Rush despite getting Glass Cannon, I just didn't want to dig into this.

Mask Keeper just needs work in general. Hoping to find a fight that let's you get a fast fight with good RNG but still win with bad RNG.

## Changelog
##### 1/29/26
- Give Sciel 3 more Might in Old Lumiere
- Added note on learning Rain of Fire before Ultimate Sakapatate

##### 1/25/26
- These are just note fixes, route is unchanged
- Don't remve DE2 from Verso in Monoco Station
- Fix Sciel stat attribution in Old Lumiere
- Add Visages Merchant into notes, it was completely missing.
- Pick up Color of Lumina in Sirene (not needed but costs no time)

##### 1/24/26
- Goblu fight is 5T by default.
- Fight Petank in Ancient Sanctuary
- Added note to go for double Powerful if Maelle didn't crit Percee
- 29 Might on Maelle is now required for Tournament
- Upgrade Lighterim to 8 and Medalum to 6 after Gestral Village
- Sciel gets 1 Agility now at Esquie's Nest. This fixes Dualliste turn order (stats were the same as last patch, think this breaking is a patch issue).
- No longer get $1775 on Continent by Chromatic Bruler
- No longer do Continent fight for Lanceram 6
- Get Delaram in SWC
- Equip First Strike to Gustave and fight Rocher to setup Lune HP and get 1 point towards learning First Strike (needed for Monoco)
- Lampmaster P1 needs more counters now
- Verso now learns Powerful instead of Perfect Recovery at the start of Act II.
- Normal Dualliste is the default now, removed mention of fast fight in main notes.
- DONT put At Death's Door on Lune early now, need Verso to have it so we get 1 point of progress on it.
- Equip First Strike Lumina on Sciel before Monoco
- Monoco fight slightly altered
- Flag moved back to Old Lumiere instead of Monoco Station
- Lune now replaces Death's Door instead of First Strike for Renoir 1.
- Lune stats slightly different in Old Lumiere, Monoco maxes Agility
- No longer get Auto Rush
- Recommend 1 counter for damage on Renoir 1.
- Get Glass Cannon & Resplendant in Visages, use Monoco for death battle.
- Lune's Lumina menu is different (needs Augmented First Strike for death)
- Mask Keeper fight sucks now, I put in the non-RNG one but you can get a faster fight if willing to gamble on Lune AP generation. On this patch, you don't have the damage to back up bad pattern well.
- Camp before Sirene Scielson 11 Lighterim 14
- Sirene defaults to fast fight now using Delaram
- Pick up Resplendant in Monolith
- Monolith Lune stats upgrades are different
- Renoir 2 is very tight since Gradient no longer hits max damage. Need to be very close to half and do headshots.
- Lune & Sciel equip Glass Cannon before Paintress
- Paintress requires a Verso Attack T2, but phase 2 only need to counter giant brush to skip a Verso attack.
- Buy 5 Resplendants from Merchant following.
- Maelle gets 7 Lumina so she can get Glass Cannon
- Maelle no longer needs Last Chance because no way to get 2 Sciel turns before Creation, so just letting Creation kill us.
