# Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 All Achievements Expert Glitchless Route

---

### Notation
For menus, I will sometimes have something in parenthesis. If it's (S1-3), it refers to the slot the Picto should be placed in. If it's a Playstation controller button, it's a button you should press to optimize the menu.

For battles, there will sometimes be something like (1.1 QTE). This refers to the Quick Time Action you do when you use an Ability. A perfect is 1.2, a normal is 1.1, and a fail is 1.0. The number refers to the damage multiplier the skill gets from the QTE.

---

You can check the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

These are my personal notes for the category, the writing will reflect that. For the most part these notes will not say where to go or where things are, just what to do. I will be updating these as the route progresses, changes will be reflected in the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

There will also be enemy data and maybe some other useful information at the bottom of the notes.

If there's a time listed by a fight, it's my best time for it so far. It does not represent the average.

## Prologue

<Menu>

#### Maelle 450HP (0:24-0:27)
> 1XP, $50, Colour of Lumina

Option 1: Attack > Parry > Overcharge > Parry > Attack (0:24 w/crit, 0:27 without)
Option 2: Attack > Parry > Attack > Dodge, Overcharge (0:26). If you get hit instead of dodging add 1 shot.

On average, optimal choice is probably to go for Option 2 if you don't get the parry crit T1.
If you crit an attack with Option 2, you can save 1s by intentionally getting hit by 1 of Maelle's 3 hits.

Good or bad fight depends on targetting, bad fight loses ~30s.
1st phase you need Sciel or Verso. 2nd phase you NEED Verso target at the start. If you don't get the right moves turn 1, you can refer to mediocre fight below.

##### Turn 0
- Verso: Berserk Slash

> Note that if you hit all crits and he targets Verso with the jump attack move, you can kill off the first Berserk Slash.
> If that happens, you Immolation T1. After the transition, Intervention > Berserk Slash, and next turn Lune Tint Sciel, Berserk Slash > Intervention > Berserk Slash. You don't need to counter his moves in phase 2.

##### Turn 1
- Lune: Energy Tint Verso / Immolation
- Verso: Berserk Slash
- Sciel: Intervention Verso
- Verso: Defiant Strike / Berserk Slash

Parry only the AoE moves, and you can dodge 1 to avoid the counter unless noted otherwise.
You want to slightly underdamage, so you can kill with the parry counter on her 4th move.

##### Turn 0

#### Phase 2
> - Summons giant brush of light: 3 hit aoe, parry on swing. Has audio cue similar to Chroma Waves
> - Flies into the air: 5 hit, 2nd dodge on twirl, 3rd is slow, 4th is right after 3rd.
> - Tears reality apart: 5 projectiles, dodge / parry at their "arc". Randomly start from left or right.
> - Paintress unleashes: 7 single target into AoE
> - Attacks from afar: Jump into 3 parry. Patient for jump

You might not need all this damage, but you do need to keep doing stuff to generate Gradient

##### Turn 1
