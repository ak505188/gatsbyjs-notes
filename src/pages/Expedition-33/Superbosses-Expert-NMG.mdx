# Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Expert Glitchless DLC Superbosses Route

Goal of this category is to defeat Osquio and the 4 Endless Tower Superbosses as fast as possible. This uses Expert Glitchless Any% as a base. First 2 Acts are very similar, but this does pick up a few extra pictos.

---

### Notation
For menus, I will sometimes have something in parenthesis. If it's (S1-3), it refers to the slot the Picto should be placed in. If it's a Playstation controller button, it's a button you should press to optimize the menu.

For battles, there will sometimes be something like (1.1 QTE). This refers to the Quick Time Action you do when you use an Ability. A perfect is 1.2, a normal is 1.1, and a fail is 1.0. The number refers to the damage multiplier the skill gets from the QTE.

Cutscene menu: you can open a menu right before you enter a cutscene transition, which will give you about 3s of menu time before the cutscene plays. You can use this to squeeze in menus and reduce wasted time. Menus will be labeled with which cutscenes they can be done during. Note that this seperates the menus, so if you're not doing cutscene menus you will want to combine them into one menu.

---

You can check the changelog at the bottom of the notes. This changelog will be restarted for this patch, so to check older stuff refer to the older patch notes.

These are my personal notes for the category, the writing will reflect that. For the most part these notes will not say where to go or where things are, just what to do. I will be updating these as the route progresses, changes will be reflected in the changelog at the bottom of the notes.

There will also be enemy data and maybe some other useful information at the bottom of the notes.

If there's a time listed by a fight, it's my best time for it so far. It does not represent the average.

## Prologue

<Battle>

#### Maelle 450HP (0:24-0:27)
> 1XP, $50, Colour of Lumina

Option 1: Attack > Parry > Overcharge > Parry > Attack (0:24 w/crit, 0:27 without)
Option 2: Attack > Parry > Attack > Dodge, Overcharge (0:26). If you get hit instead of dodging add 1 shot.

On average, optimal choice is probably to go for Option 2 if you don't get the parry crit T1.
If you crit an attack with Option 2, you can save 1s by intentionally getting hit by 1 of Maelle's 3 hits.

</Battle>
