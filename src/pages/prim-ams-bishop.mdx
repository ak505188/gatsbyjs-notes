> This is fight is always cleanly winnable as long as you have someone between Redeye turns T1.
> You have 3 goals for T1, from then on the fight is free.
>
> 1. Don't let anyone die. AKA whoever is between Redeye turns heal whoever got hit. Best to worst characters to heal with: Tressa, H'aanit, Primrose, Therion.
> 2. Get Prim before Redeye T2. A lot of the time she'll be faster by default, but if not Defend or Leghold.
> 3. Break 2 Shields, he needs to be 3 Shields or less T2 so Prim can break.
>
> If he does manage to double tap someone, it can be recovered. It might rely on getting a good turn order T3 so you can skip a Defend T2 and use a Pom. Luckily, odds of him double tapping someone are low thanks to heals & Cover.
>
> Damagewise, Alephans + Aelfrics + Peacock + Ignisx4 does ~17000-~17600 * 6 = ~102000-~105600
> The Lux used to break will do ~3300, ~4650 with Peacock & about 500 more for every Shield below 3.
> You will generally need an M Stone to finish him, very rarely you might need an L with really bad rolls.
> If you have a free turn on someone, you can also just Pom M Prim T1. BPx2 Lux will do roughly double the damage above.
>
> I'm not going to cover all possible fights in the turns below, just give a rough outline of how it goes. I recommend practicing this fight a bit, it's not hard at all and you'll get a much better feel for it doing it a few times instead of reading all this.
