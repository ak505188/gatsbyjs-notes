##### Alternate Kiba Strat
| Viktor     | Hero       |
|------------|------------|
| Miklotov   | **Camus**  |
| **Adlai**  | **Chaco**  |

Go to bed
__Option 2__ to start battle

### Kiba War Battle
#### Standard Strat
##### Turns 1-5
Move 3R1U

##### Turn 6
Luc Wind Magic
Flik Fire Spear (If Luc failed)
Gilbert DR

##### Turn 7
Hero
Gilbert 2R
Luc Wind Magic (If Kiba < 2 damage)
Flik Fire Spear (If Kiba < 2 damage)

##### Turn 8 & on
Use Judgement

#### Alternate Strat
> Can use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1a6RA_gIds) as a reference.

> So this strat revolves around pulling Kiba's army away from your main army's position. With Chaco & Camus, we have enough defense that Rowd's army will never attack Hero & Kiba's army will tend to not attack you in melee range.
> First 3 turns are always the same, afterwards you might have to adjust Hero's movement based on enemy unit positions.
> Turn 4 you probably want to move as far right as possible without getting in range of an enemy unit.
> Turn 5 you'll probably need to move left & down to pull the soldiers furthest to the top left towards you instead of Viktor.
> Turn 6 you want to move Viktor, Flik, Teresa away & move Hero towards the top right side. Make sure that the soldier's to the left are closer to Hero than they are to Viktor. 
> Turn 7 move Hero towards the top right, preferably into a chokepoint that minimizes attacks. Move Viktor, Flik, Teresa away a bit more.
> Turn 8 & on just move Kobolds away and minimize attacks on Hero.

> This strat by my estimate is approximately 1 minute slower than killing Kiba. There is variance, it depends on how many attacks there are during the battle. If you're going for WR standard Kiba makes more sense. If you're trying to improve, PB, or just practice I think this strat is better because of how much more consistent it is.

##### Turn 1
Hero 2R1D

##### Turn 2&3
Hero 2R

##### Turn 4&on
Use Hero to pull Kiba's army to the right, move rest of army away from Kiba's army.

Kiba Option 1 then __Option 2__

> [Rune Unite Speed Glitch Explanation on Suikosource.](http://www.suikosource.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=12441&start=650)

> The Rune Unite Speed Glitch gives a 1.3 speed multiplier to certain Rune Unites. 
> It's the same modifer that healing spells, healing items, and Empty World get.

> If you want to get a better idea of how it works I recommend reading the link above. For the speedrun, we take advantage of the fact that Flaming Arrows Scroll, Bandanna, and Robe take up 3 adjacent early slots in the inventory heap. When we use the Flaming Arrow scroll on Kyaro Soldiers, we open up that slot and it gets filled by Jowy's Tunic when he rejoins your party. Then, when we get Bright Shield, he leaves your party again & removes Tunic from the heap. And it's slot is replaced by the Bright Shield we get at that point. That's why a Hazy Crystal drop affects the setup, if we get that it fills the Tunic's slot instead of Bright Shield.

> We purposely keep Bandanna & Robe in our inventory to keep those slots occupied, essentially using them as placeholders. Before we start the Luca sequence, we toss all our Bandanna's & Robe's to open up those slots.

> The Luca sequence has a unique property where Hero & his equipment and runes are removed from the heap. Unless we got Hazy drop, we now have 3 open slots near the start of the item heap. When Hero rejoins & his items are readded, the first things loaded into the heap are his runes. It goes Weapon, Head, Right, Left, then armor. The goal is to have Bright Shield loaded in the slot after Lightning, this sets up the glitch. Since we have 3 slots available, the list will go: Friendship, Lightning, Bright Shield, which sets up the glitch. This is also why we skip equipping Friendship if we got the Hazy Crystal drop: we can't guarantee that we have the first of 3 slots open anymore. So we leave 2 open & have Lightning & Bright Shield loaded into them.
