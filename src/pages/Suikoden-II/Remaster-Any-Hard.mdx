##### Turn 7
Riou
Gilbert 2R
Luc Wind Magic (If Kiba < 2 damage)

##### Turn 8 & on
Use Judgement

#### Alternate Strat
> Can use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1a6RA_gIds) as a reference.

> So this strat revolves around pulling Kiba's army away from your main army's position. With Chaco & Camus, we have enough defense that Rowd's army will never attack Riou & Kiba's army will tend to not attack you in melee range.
> First 3 turns are always the same, afterwards you might have to adjust Riou's movement based on enemy unit positions.
> Turn 4 you probably want to move as far right as possible without getting in range of an enemy unit.
> Turn 5 you'll probably need to move left & down to pull the soldiers furthest to the top left towards you instead of Viktor.
> Turn 6 you want to move Viktor, Flik, Teresa away & move Riou towards the top right side. Make sure that the soldier's to the left are closer to Riou than they are to Viktor. 
> Turn 7 move Riou towards the top right, preferably into a chokepoint that minimizes attacks. Move Viktor, Flik, Teresa away a bit more.
> Turn 8 & on just move Kobolds away and minimize attacks on Riou.

> This strat by my estimate is approximately 1 minute slower than killing Kiba. There is variance, it depends on how many attacks there are during the battle. If you're going for WR standard Kiba makes more sense. If you're trying to improve, PB, or just practice I think this strat is better because of how much more consistent it is.

##### Turn 1
Riou 2R1D

| **Special** | **Now feel my deadly sword.**                                |
| **Defend**  | **Unf... You like to take risks, eh.**                       |
| **Attack**  | **Very good, boy.**                                          |
| **Special** | **Watch and learn, boy. Here's how to wield a sword!!!**     |
| **Defend**  | **Well struck... It seems I should be more careful...**      |
| **Special** | **You think my sword has lost its bite?!!!**                 |
| **Defend**  | **You think you can beat me, boy?**                          |
| Special     | Can you take this?                                           |

| Defend      | Genkaku... You raised a good son...                          |
| Attack      | I may be old, but I haven't lost my sword arm.               |
| Defend      | Let me see your power, son of Genkaku!                       |
| Special     | Let's see if you can withstand another of my blows!          |
| Defend      | The leader of the - Army is cautious,  I see...              |
| Defend      | Try that again, boy.                                         |
| Attack      | Unf... Your father would have been proud to see you today... |

| Defend      | What will you do now, boy?                                   |
| Defend      | What's wrong? Want to try again?                             |
| Special     | Yes, but can you defend against my sword?!                   |
| Attack      | You can't defend yourself forever.                           |
| Attack      | You can't win like that, boy.                                |
| Special     | You'll have to do better than that.                          |
| Attack      | You're a tough one...                                        |
