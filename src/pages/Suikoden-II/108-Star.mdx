- *If 6|5 or worse*: Book(s)

Note the time you exit the dialogue with the trader. Do not talk to him again until approximately 12 minutes and 33 seconds have passed since this moment.

> Explanation: you need the amount of minutes IGT to advance by 12-14 between trades. That let's the trade shop refresh 4 times. Note that this doesn't consider seconds, so if you exited the dialogue at IGT 35 minutes 0 seconds, you would need to enter at 47 minutes 0 seconds. This takes approximately 12 minutes 33 seconds if you watch the Muse Wolf cutscene. If you exited at 35 minutes 59 seconds, you would need to enter at 47 minutes 0 seconds as well. This would let you enter 59 seconds faster, but there is no good way to track IGT so best to play it safe.

### Castle
Go to 1st floor, teleport to Kyaro (X) and run to Tenzan Pass.

### Kyaro > Tenzan Pass
Can remove Master Garb for potentially faster fight.
Wild Attack when Jowy Defends, Defend when he attacks.

Each duel ends after 3 turns if you never attacked, or once Riou is low enough HP if you did attack.
I think it's best to only Defend on 1st duel, and pick appropriate option on 2nd duel.
With Master Garb equipped, there's a chance 1st duel is a 4 turn with Wild Attack.


| __Defend__                  | __Wild Attack__                    |
