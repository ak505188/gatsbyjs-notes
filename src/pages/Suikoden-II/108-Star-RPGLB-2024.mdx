Note the time you exit the dialogue with the trader. Do not talk to him again until approximately 12 minutes and 33 seconds have passed since this moment.

> Explanation: you need the amount of minutes IGT to advance by 12-14 between trades. That let's the trade shop refresh 4 times. Note that this doesn't consider seconds, so if you exited the dialogue at IGT 35 minutes 0 seconds, you would need to enter at 47 minutes 0 seconds. This takes approximately 12 minutes 33 seconds if you watch the Muse Wolf cutscene. If you exited at 35 minutes 59 seconds, you would need to enter at 47 minutes 0 seconds as well. This would let you enter 59 seconds faster, but there is no good way to track IGT so best to play it safe.

Go to 1st floor, teleport to Kyaro (X) and run to Tenzan Pass.

### Kyaro > Tenzan Pass
Can remove Master Garb for potentially faster fight.
Wild Attack when Jowy Defends, Defend when he attacks.

Each duel ends after 3 turns if you never attacked, or once Riou is low enough HP if you did attack.
I think it's best to only Defend on 1st duel, and pick appropriate option on 2nd duel.
With Master Garb equipped, there's a chance 1st duel is a 4 turn with Wild Attack.
