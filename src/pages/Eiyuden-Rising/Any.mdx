### Runebarrows - Depths
Ignore all chests here.

1st screen take your time, kill stuff with Isha. Use CJ to break the Lightning barriers.

Next screen jump over Golems, might take damage but worth it.

#### Forced Battle 2
Flans: Stay away from them, hit with Isha. Link CJ > Isha when possible.

## 30: Where This All Began
#### Hurstwine 27654HP
Start with Isha, hit Bandits, walk back. 3 more hits, link to CJ and back.
Switch between CJ and Isha. You want to get Hurstwine near the middle of the screen.
If he's in a corner, just hit him with Isha and focus on dodging.
Once he's in the middle, use **Power Balm LVL5**.
Dash behind him constantly with CJ and DPS.

> The Power Balm LV5 is used in the middle because it can run out on Sorcerer. If you're confident in your fights, you can use it at the start.

Pick **Healing Potion LVL5**.

#### Sorcerer 32336HP
DPS & dodge, if he bring up earth shield break with Garoo.
Fire attack is the dangerous one, best way to dodge is to go behind him.

#### Sorcerer Pt.2 13434HP
Pattern: Move left-right with CJ, clearing adds when possible. Priority is dodging.
When he starts charging up big explosion,get to corner. Double jump, and right after explosion air dash onto platform.
Switch to Isha, 3 Attacks > Link CJ > Link Isha > Link CJ > Dash into switch Isha > 3 Attacks
Repeat till win. Ideally 2 cycle, most likely 3, maybe even 4.

More advanced pattern, jump on platform, and when you see blue rings where the Sorcerer appears, do 3 Isha up-forward attacks, link through the explosion. Note that Isha can get hit, so you want her healthy.
From there, same pattern as above, but you can link CJ after and do 2ATK D.ATK loops with Isha swaps.
You can also break his shield by hitting him in the air. If you do, you can hit him for damage but not long after the shield breaks he will go into explosion mode, and you have to wait for the Sorcerer to appear to do damage again.

Split on black screen after achievement. GG
