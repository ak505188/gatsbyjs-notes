### Starting Stat Manipulation
This game has a very easy way to manipulate starting stats for all your characters.
Simply reset the console, and hit New Game to get seed 0. Back out, and hit new game again to get seed 1, etc.
Load game works as well.

We are going to use Seed 15, RNG 0x71798ad5 post calculation. 

**To do this, press New Game / Load Game and back out 15 times. Then press New Game, pick your settings, and start the run.**

To confirm correct seed:
- Lazlo HP: 21
- Snowe HP: 22

### Intro Battle
Say no to tutorial

- **Lazlo**: 1 Forward (east)
- **Snowe**: 1 Down 1 Forward
- **Lazlo**: 1 Down, attack
- **Snowe**: 1 Forward, attack

### Intro Battle 2
> Really don't want Kyril to level, Battle at Sea gets way tighter.

Too much variance for set strat. Kill Elemental ASAP, move units towards right. Kyril can bait by moving forward and placing Flame Force Bead on self. Kill left once they get closer.

### The Night Sea #2
> If you finish kill all other Pirates before Kyril's 3rd turn (Fish Spawn), the battle ends.

> If Jolly or Rowdy got hit twice, you want to Medicine them with Edgar. If Edgar got stunned, can do it with Brandeau instead. BUT ONLY if Jolly + Rowdy will kill an enemy Pirate.

#### Rewards

Positions don't matter much, want people in certain quadrants.
Kangacorn riders bottom left quadrant, others top right quadrant.

#### Strategy
**DON'T EVER STAND ON FIRE TILES!**

##### Turn 1
- **Millay**: Go to Wind Elemental's right side (where it was if it moved), **DISMOUNT**, attack to kill it.
- **Corselia**: Start casting Blazing Wall.
- **Kyril**: Water Bead Corselia.
- **Kangacorn Riders**: Mount Kangacorn, go to places to place tiles, switch to Kika / Seneca and Rage Force Bead.
   - You should generally only need 2, the third is a backup. If you still can't cover all enemies, focus on the ones more to the right. You can kill one with Millay as a backup next turn.
   - Can swap to **Ema** for 3rd bead.
- **Wendel**: Switch to **Andarc**, Blazing Wall
- **Pablo**: Switch to Flare, Lightning Force for Andarc.

##### Turn 2
- **Mages**: Cast Blazing Wall again.
- **Millay**: Mount, Move 2 behind between where Seneca & Kika will be.
- **Seneca & Kika**: Move to 1 left/right center of rock, 2 below it's start. For reference, it's 3 up from Kyril's / top right starting tile. Each use Flame Force 2 infront of their position. Center of rock is same column as Mercenary Leader.
- **Kyril**: Move towards Seneca & Kika, Wind Force to get tile between them.
   - This can maybe be skipped if they face towards middle, to make Leader step on Fire tile. Can also be skipped if the leader went toward's a side, not straight down middle. Actually maybe always make them face middle and Wind Force between them.

##### Turn 3
- Millay kill any remaining units, should just be Fire Mage.

##### Turn 2

- *Archer vs No Archer kill plays mostly the same. Difference is Fire Mage gets to live an extra turn.*
- **Millay**: Mount Kangacorn.

### Mido Plains (Martin Duel)
#### Martin LVL3 strat:
1. 2 Back, Swallow, 4 Back
2. Swallow, 2 Back 3 Right
3. Swallow, 2 Right 3 Up
4. 1 Down 2 Left, Swallow. 3 Down towards wall.
5. Swallow

##### No LVL3
- If you will level up off a Swallow hit. T1 move up left, Swallow, move to wall. Face away from wall. Next turn finish with Swallow / back attack.
- If you won't level, move to wall so he can reach you from 2 side. Wind Force to your side that he can't reach, and face towards side with no Wind Tiles. He should attack you next to Wind Tile, and you attack him next turn from that Wind Tile. Accuracy is an issue.

#### Beads
- Millay: Mother Earth, Rage
- Fredrica: Rage
- Ornela: Rage
- Pablo: Flowing
- Kyril: Rage

#### Info
- Ameria needs Godspeed. Role can be played by any character with 7 movement that can ride a Kangacorn and is slower than all enemies.
- Simeon Blazing Wall T2 is a decent option, with Lino taking a Kangacorn and placing a Rage Force Bead under a back archer. Pablo can also place one.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
- **Ornela**: 9 Forward, Rage Force Bead under bottom left Red Soldier.
- **Millay**: 10 Forward, **DISMOUNT**. Mother Earth Bead under bottom left Blue Soldier, **FACE RIGHT**.

- **Busk**: Move behind Ornela, switch to Lino. Unicorn lvl2 3 Red Soldiers.
- **Jewel/Paula**: Move adjacent to Ornela, switch to Simeon. Silent Lake middle Blue Soldier.
- **Paula/Paula**: Move behind Simeon, switch to Pablo. Co-op **Bottom Left** Soldier.
- *You don't go for the hit on 6 because the archer kill is a range, and if he lives he runs away and Mega Medicines.*
- *Yellow Archer should hit Millay, other units should move towards Millay but not quite reach.*
- **Kyril**: 2 Left 4 Up. Rage Force Bead on bottom middle of circle (4 Up).
- **Ameria**: Mount Kangacorn. 10 Forward, in front of Simeon. Switch to Corselia, Explosion and nuke as many as you can. Extra move to a Water Tile in the top right corner after.

##### Turn 2
 **No important character should end up on a Fire Tile**.
- **Ornela**: Mount Kangacorn, 7 Forward 2 Right, Lightning Bead on self. Face down.
- *If there was a survivor kill instead, as long as you can get to right tile.*
- **Millay**: 5 Right 5 Down. If survivor that Ornela can't kill, Millay kill instead.
- **Fredrica**: Mount **RED OWL**. 2 Left 6 Down.

> Goal is for Simeon and Lino is to kill at least 3 archers, so Millay can finish last one.

- **Lino**: Either Unicorn or mount Owl and place Rage Bead for Blazing Wall.
- **Simeon**: Forward Max, try to hit Archers further away with Explosion. The closer ones can be dealt with with Lino Unicorn. Can also have Lino Owl and place Rage Bead and Blazing Wall.
- **Pablo**: Move towards Simeon, Water Bead under Pablo & Simeon. If Blazing Wall, just move to non-Fire tile.
- **Kyril**: Swallow Ogre Breath Chest (Left chest)
- **Corselia**: Start casting Blazing Wall

##### Turn 3
- **Ornela**: Kill an archer out of range of Simeon. If not an archer, can kill something else or just chill.
- **Millay**: Kill an archer or Rage Force Bead.

##### Beads
- Ornela: Mother Earth
- Kyril: Flowing

#### Strategy
General strategy is fast people rush bottom, Kyril hides in corner & Corselia kills enemies to protect Kyril.
Can kill up to 7 enemies. When you kill 8 enemies more spawn.

##### Turn 1
- **Ornela**: 8 Down.
- **Jewel**: Mount White Owl, 10 Down. Switch to Paula. *If already on Owl, dismount before switch. Used to slow her down.*
- **Ameria**: Switch to Corselia, move 5 Right or 1 Down 4 Right, Breath of Ice or Explosion. Make sure you kill Wind Mage on bottom part. Extra move back to furthest Water tile.
- **Kyril**: Flowing Force Bead 1 Down 3 Right. Move into bottom corner.

##### Turn 2
- **Ornela**: 2 Down 4 Right (out of range of cannon.)
- **Paula**: Mount **Armored** Kangacorn, Rush chest. Forward max. *Normal Kangacorn should work fine too*.
- **Kyril**: Try to kill someone, preferably with Cyclone Sword.
- **Corselia**: Kill something with Flaming Arrows
- Kyril and Corselia just kill stuff and hide from now on. Kyril can Swallow LVL3 people.
- Normal Kangacorn should be fine, I tested with 60SPD Jewel & 57SPD Ornela and it still worked out. Might be more based on Millay's speed.

##### Turn 3
- **Ornela**: Forward max twice.
- **Paula**: Switch to Millay. Mount White Owl. 1 Down 8 Right, Owl Heart. **Make sure you move first before Owl Heart!**

> Iskas should move 4 left with these positions, even if there's an Earth Tile there.

##### Turn 4
> Ornela needs to be before Iskas. Millay needs to be after Iskas. Iskas should Flaming Arrow Ornela unless Cannon shenaningans, then he casts Berserk Blow.

- **Ornela**: 5 Up, Mother Earth Bead 3 Right 1 Up so 1 tile under Iskas. Extra Move 3 Left. *(1 down 1 left from cannon.)*
- **Millay**: Move behind Iskas and attack to kill. Shouldn't even need to Dismount.

> If Millay misses, or if you run into issues because of the Rune Cannon, you can Extra Move Millay out of the way 
and have Ornela attack from behind too. If the cannon places Lightning Tiles under Iskas, probably better for Millay to switch to Pablo and place a Earth Tile under Iskas, and have Ornela attack him from behind on a Lightning tile.

#### Information
Iskas doesn't want to attack people that are on midair tiles.
Every point of SKL = 1% more accuracy vs Iskas (and probably in general).
Bottom Right Chest Guardian Vestment
Left Chest Hero's Armor
More units spawn after killing 8 units
Iskas is Lightning Element
Units keep Spawning 1 by one even after second phase
Rune Cannons inflict random statuses

### Fishskas
#### Setup
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Paula (RO)', x: 2, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Fredrica', x: 2, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Ornela (K)', x: 2, y: 3 },
]}/>

**REMOVE CORSELIA AND SIMEON FROM FORMATION**.
Order supposed to be Ornela > Fishskas > Jewel > Busk > Eye

##### Strategy
- Ornela: 7 Right, Mother Earth Bead 4 Right under Fishskas
- Paula: 7 Right 2 Up. Switch to Simeon & Flowing Force 1 Down 1 Right
- Fredrica: 8 Right behind Red Fish, Switch to Corselia. Flaming Arrow Fishskas.

### Evil Eye
##### Information
- Evil Eye has 2 damage gates, at 33% & 66%. After each one it will back away and start charging. First unlocks it's column attack. After 2nd charge it does the big nuke.
- It does physical damage with its bunch of beams attack.

##### Strategy
 1. 1 Forward, Cyclone Force 4 Forward
 2. 3 Forward, Swallow LVL3. Extra move 1 more forward, to center Wind tile. Eye should move away now.
 3. Standby, face towards it.
 4. Move behind it, Swallow LVL3 for kill.

After Mirror breaking cutscene **DONT MASH TRIANGLE**. Kyril gets stuck until you stop mashing.
Final Textbox is Corselia ""Kyril... Kyril!!"

## General Information
#### Counterattack
Can counter when hit
Probability reduced by enemy Bull's Eye.
25%/50% penalty to counter attack & avoidance when hit from side/back.
Can reduce penalty with Mind's Eye.

#### Mounts
Kangacorns: +3 MOV, JMP = 1
Normal kangacorn: +50% STR, +10% SPD... -30% EVA
Armored Kangacorn: +50% STR, +30% PDF... -30% EVA
Useable by 1h sword, spear and missile weapon users.

Owls: +2 MOV, JMP = 4 (dunno if that has any effect for the owls)
Red/Blue Giant Owl: +30% STR, +30% EVA, +30% SPD... -30% PDF
White Giant Owl (Armored): +30% STR, +30% EVA... -10% PDF
Useable by 1h sword, spear, and most archers (not Seneca). Archers have their range increased by 1 while on an owl.

#### Coops
kfcrispy: i don't know the coop damage formula, but they definitely don't use Battle Lust. perhaps they use raw stats (affected by terrain) and the base power like a spell

Can maybe test via editing stats.
+ATK (Seared Bonito) doesn't increase damage
Enemy Tile very slightly affects damage? (Went from 123 to 130 in test, going from positive to neutral)
Positive tile for allies slightly affects damage (Neutral tile Kyril 123, pos tile Kyril 133)

#### Items
Puffered Fish Sashimi doesn't raise M.ATK?

#### Firefly
If Enemies can't hit Eugene normally, but can hurt him by placing tiles they will place tiles.

#### Status
- **Unfriendly**: Also stops recharging of Co-ops.
- **Accuracy +**: Increases accuracy by 10%

#### Current Ideas
Post Obel can do sharpen / shop in Illuya instead of Nay.
Benefits:
- Has Rune Shop, early Gale potentially
- Potential tier 2 beads in bargains
- Crab Bun
Downsides:
- No Seared Bonito

#### Ranking
http://suikosource.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5022&sid=6a16db4f67d1fabdf82b6b494eeb3511&start=45#p155223
##### Criteria explanation
Turn amount: number of actions made regardless of foe or friend (!!!)
Total damage: The total damage all allies (excluding NPCs) received
Damage rate: The average damage dealt to enemies from attacks (including runes)
Positive element count: The number of times your allies (excluding NPCs) end a turn on positive element
Total value of received experience: self-explaining

##### Numeric values to determine the rank
STEP1 Determining the rank for each criteria
• Turn amount & total damage
S: base value +0%
A: base value +30%
B: base value +80%
C: above
• Damage rate & positive element count & total experience value
S: base value -0%
A: base value -30%
B: base value -80%
C: below
- Each stage has different base values (?) [Look at the sheet that KFCrispy shared some posts ago]
- [I don’t understand the first sentence] A missed attack is counted as an attack that did 0 damage
- [Not sure but it seems…] The base value for experience is 500 per enemy.
STEP2 For each of the 5 criteria you’ll get a score depending on the rank you achieved in each criteria
S: 0 A: 10 B: 30 C: 60
STEP3 These scores are used to calculate an average score that will finally determine the stage rank
S: less than 5 A: less than 13 B: less than 31 C: 31 or more
[-> it means you can A rank in 2 criteria as long as you S rank the remaining 3, because you would get 10+10+0+0+0=10 -> 20/5=4 -> S rank! If you B rank in any criteria there's no chance of getting stage rank S!]

#### Eugene days
Based off day in Obel.

Water Day: Move to Illuya, then Na-Nal
Wind Day: Na-Nal, Illuya, Na-Nal
Lightning: Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Fire: Illuya, Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Earth: Na-Nal

#### Legacy Graska 2
#### Setup
Backline formation doesn't matter except Kyril.
Middle front should be slower of Jewel / Paula.
Assuming Jewel is faster, adjust accordingly.
Speedwise ideally it's Ornela, Fredrica/Millay, Jewel, Paula.
Can adjust with mounts and/or Godspeed Anklets.
Want Paula to be 39SPD or more.
Ornela & Millay on Kangacorns.

##### Requirements
Fredrica: Rage/Fire Bead
Millay: Earth/Mother Earth Bead
Ornela: Cyclone Force Bead

Formation

Busk Kyril Simeon -
Millay Fredrica Paula Jewel Ornela

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Ornela: 7D (Even with back Red Soldiers)b, Cyclone Force Bead. Ideally on front guy in second group, but if Earth/Fire already set tile in front of Ornela works. Important part is to get Wind tile infront of front Blue Spearman.
Millay: 9D1R, Earth Force Bead middle spearman / Mother Earth Force tile below middle spearman.
Fredrica: Mount if not mounted, move next to front red swordsman and Fire Tile middle / Rage tile front.
Jewel: 8D1L, behind back red swordsman. Swap to Lino & Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Spearman.
Paula: 9D, swap to Seneca and Hawk LVL3. Should kill 6. Ideally front 8 are dead here.

Simeon: move up and Breath of Ice Ogre Breath (Left Chest)
Busk: move up
Kyril: move down

##### Turn 2
Simeon: Flowing Force Bead center column, 3 north of chest. Can move cursor to chest, move left to middle, then up 3.
Busk: move up (not into water).
Fredrica: move down, swap to Kika and kill something.
Rest: keep moving down and killing stuff. Be careful with Millay. Unit deaths don't matter but permadeath does.

##### Turn 3 & on.
Simeon move into front water tile.
When top soldiers spawn Breath of Ice middle 2. Busk gets on owl and kills right one.
Rest keep doing same thing.


### Haruna Previous
#### Setup
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Trishtan (K)', x: 1, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Kyril', x: 1, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Gretchen', x: 1, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Andarc', x: 1, y: 3 },
  { name: 'Eugene', x: 0, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Ameria', x: 0, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Jeremy', x: 0, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Pablo', x: 0, y: 3 },
]}/>

Note: Pablo is assumed to be slowest character here, doesn't have to be Pablo but you need someone slower than everyone else here.
Most slots are interchangable as well. Only important ones should be Kyril & Trishtan. The 4 Kangacorn riders are interchangable.

##### Beads
- Seneca: Wind x2
- Kika: Wind x2
- Flare: Flame, (Cyclone Sword)

##### Turn 4
- Top side changes depending on turn order. If Millay can reach the mage, go for the kill on the mage. If not, Kill 2 closest and Extra Move out of range. Kika its 5 back, Millay it's 1 up 1 left of Kika. Be mindful of archer getting double turn if killing mage. Also, Kika won't kill the Soldier without elemental advantage.
- Bottom half kills rest, chills.

##### Turn 5
- Top side finishes remaining 2 units.
