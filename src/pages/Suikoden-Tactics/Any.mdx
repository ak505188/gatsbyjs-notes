##### Turn 3

Once you clear out enough fish with other group start moving forward. Don't move too far though, or you risk getting Breath of Iced by far back fish.

## Hope in Haruma
### Caravan
### Haruna
#### Setup
Formation
Andarc Kika Millay Corselia
Trishtan Kyril Seneca

#### Strategy
We REALLY want to S Rank this.

##### Turn 1
Trishtan move to start of wooden board between roofs, **Dismount**, Wind Force Tile 2 tiles to his left and face left.
Kika move up to first soldier and Falcon Thrust. Face up.
Millay move between 2 back soldiers and Rush right one. Face left.

Rest move up.
Andarc Berserk Blow wooden board soldier if you can do so safely, if not Berserk Blow rooftop soldier / nothing (for Extra Move). Continue to move up on right side of roof, outside of left archer range.
Corselia can try to Breath of Ice soldier on roof (as long as she'll level from the exp.) Still want to cast Breath of Ice for Extra move even if cancelled.
Seneca & Kyril move up and attack remaining soldier if possible. If not, Standby and do it next turn.

##### Turn 2 and on
Get Trishtan out of choke if there's someone in front of him so Kika or Millay can break through. Make sure you kill the soldier on the roof here.
Corselia move towards Simeon and Breath of Ice the 3 soldiers, hitting Simeon too if necessary. Killing them should spawn next group.

Keep moving up safely, want to setup for Dying Wish on Turn 3.

Formation you should be aiming for is
-      Kyril   -
Seneca Chimney Andarc

The Officer moves up once you pass the chimney I'm pretty sure. Also want to hit him with a bit of damage as he won't die to just Dying Wish. Also want to put a wind tile under Seneca & Kyril, as they can get hit (Seneca by archers on roof.)

Millay & Kika slowly make way up roof on left side. Make sure you place Wind Tiles and play safe. Officer is tanky and hits hard, and need to watch for staff user Berserk Blow.

### Mido Plains
#### Setup
Bottom right corner mounts Kangacorn.

Formation:
Millay
Trishtan Kika
Kyril Frederica
Corselia Jewel Paula (Kangacorn)

Formation doesn't matter much, just want Fredrica, Paula & Jewel on right side & Paula or Jewel on right 3 tiles.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Frederica & Paula/Jewel: Set up Cohort. Mount owl if needed, move to correct tile. Switch to Seneca / Andrac (whichever has Flame Force Bead), and Flame Force Bead tile between 4 soldiers. Second one moves into 2nd Cohort position, switches to other one and Cohorts. This will kill 1-4 soldier.
Paula/Jewel: Mount Kangacorn, move to tile to the right of the right Fire Tile, switch to Simeon and Silent Lake 4 tiles ahead. Should hit all 3 mages.
Rest move up, try to set up Wind Tiles / finish remaining soldiers if some survived.
Alternatively, use Seneca first and Hawk Rune instead of fire tile. Gets more EXP, doesn't require Flame Bead and guarantees kill on last 3. Will never kill front one.
Can hopefully finish off remaining soldier with Millay or Kika before he moves.
Remaining move up and start placing down Wind Tiles.

Also, take note of speed order between Jewel, Fredrica, and Paula.

##### Turn 2 and on.
Simeon move up at least 1 tile and try to kill mages on right with Breath of Ice. Watch out for second group, they move fast and might get 2 turns before some of your characters get their second turn.
You want to move up 1 tile so you can Silent Lake the back mage next turn, so he can't Silent Lake you.

Strategy is just move up, place tiles and slowly kill stuff. Be careful, units here do hurt, especially the Kangacorn. You lose if Kyril or Corselia die and Millay perma-dying is really bad too.

Both spawns are based off unit kills.

### Mido Plains (Martin Duel)
If he does Rage Sword LVL3 run to bottom right corner, Cyclone Sword T2. When he reaches you just move behind him and attack from back.
If he doesn't just move behind him and attack and move away. He should put down fire tiles, you move left and put Wind Tiles, he moves up and attacks, you attack him from back.

## The Imperial City of Graska
### World Map
Move to Graska.

### Graska 1
Even if you kill the 3 fish and Roget at the same time, the rest will still spawn.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1

 * Millay: Move up, Rush someone if in the way. Can move towards front left to avoid fish magic attack.

Ornela & Millay on Kangacorns.

Requirements
Fredrica: Rage/Fire Bead

Ornela: Cyclone Force Bead

Formation
- Busk Kyril Simeon -
Millay Fredrica Paula Jewel Ornela

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Ornela: 8D, Cyclone Force Bead. Ideally on front guy in second group, but if Earth/Fire already set tile in front of Ornela works. Important part is to get Wind tile infront of front Blue Spearman.
Millay: 9D1R, Earth Force Bead middle spearman / Mother Earth Force tile below middle spearman.
Fredrica: Mount if not mounted, move next to front red swordsman and Fire Tile middle / Rage tile front.
Jewel: 8D1L, behind back red swordsman. Swap to Lino & Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Spearman.
Paula: 9D, swap to Seneca and Hawk LVL3. Should kill 6. Ideally front 8 are dead here.

Simeon: move up and Breath of Ice Ogre Breath.
Busk: move up
Kyril: move down

##### Turn 2
Simeon: Flowing Force Bead center column, 3 north of chest. Can move cursor to chest, move left to middle, then up 3.
Busk: move up (not into water).
Fredrica: move down, swap to Kika and kill something.
Rest: keep moving down and killing stuff. Be careful with Millay. Unit deaths don't matter but permadeath does.

##### Turn 3 & on.
Simeon move into front water tile.
When top soldiers spawn Breath of Ice middle 2. Busk gets on owl and kills right one.
Rest keep doing same thing.

#### Information.

### Iskas
Want Mother Earth Armor and beads on Millay and Ornela
Start them on 2 top right tiles with Owls. Go right, and book it towards Iskas. You can use Rush on the chest for a little boost.
Switch to Kangacorns for 1 extra MOV

When you get in range, 1st one Mother Earth Beads Iskas
Second one gets best angle possible and attacks.
If you can't attack before element change / movement, reapply Mother Earth

Other end of the fight just want to stall. Can kill a lot of them, but if you kill too many more will spawn.
Silent Lake with Simeon T1 is really good, he'll probably die for it but it's worth. Wind of Sleep is also really useful here.

#### Information
Bottom Right Chest Guardian Vestment
Left Chest Hero's Armor
More units spawn after killing a certain amount
Iskas is Lightning Element
Units keep Spawning 1 by one even after second phase
Rune Cannons inflict random statuses

### Fishskas
Setup is Millay and Ornela on Owls on right side, Fredrica & Jewel (or any 2 somewhat fast people that can use owls) in Center Middle.
You want Millay or Ornela (whoever is putting Earth tile) to be faster than Fishskas. Other one has to be faster than remaining 2.
Jewel & Fredrica need to both be faster or slower than Fishskas. Can't have 1 of each. Should always be slower.

Give Rage Robes to Andarc and Simeon. Make sure that they aren't in the party. You can kick out everyone else (doesn't matter).

Ornela or Millay move up, **dismount**, Mother Earth Bead under Fishskas. Make sure you aren't lined up with him vertically.
Ornela or Millay move up, **dismount**, Rage Bead so there's a fire tile behind a fish and a fire tile in front of a fish. Make sure you aren't lined up with Fishskas him vertically.

Jewel/Fredrica mount owl. Move to Fire Tile behind fish, switch to Simeon and Flaming Arrow Fishskas. If Simeon is strong this will kill. If not next step. Make sure you do this before Andarc's part, since he will switch field to Lightning.
Jewel/Fredrica mount owl, move to Fire tile in front of fish. Switch to Andarc, Thunder Runner for the kill.

### Evil Eye
Basically Cyclone Sword, wait for it to get closer, then LVL3 Swallow from behind.
Might take a few hits.

Final Textbox is Corsela ""Kyril... Kyril!!"
