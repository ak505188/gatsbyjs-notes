### Starting Stat Manipulation
This game has a very easy way to manipulate starting stats for all your characters.
Simply reset the console, and hit New Game to get seed 0. Back out, and hit new game again to get seed 1, etc.
Load game works as well.

We are going to use Seed 4, RNG 0x50900da post calculation. 

**To do this, press New Game / Load Game and back out 4 times. Then press New Game, pick your settings, and start the run.**

To confirm correct seed, Lazlo and Snowe should both have 19 HP.

### Intro Battle
Say no to tutorial

- **Lazlo**: 1 Forward (east)
- **Snowe**: 1 Down 1 Forward
- **Lazlo**: 1 Down, attack
- **Snowe**: 1 Forward, attack

### Intro Battle 2
> Really don't want Kyril to level, Battle at Sea gets way tighter.

Too much variance for set strat. Kill Elemental ASAP, move units towards right. Kyril can bait by moving forward and placing Flame Force Bead on self. Kill left once they get closer.

### The Night Sea #2
> If you finish kill all other Pirates before Kyril's 3rd turn (Fish Spawn), the battle ends.
> Want Andarc LVL2 preferably, so he is slower than Pirates. That way he can Thunder Runner a Pirate.
> Probably want Kyril level 1, just so you have more time.

#### Setup
#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
- **Brandeau**: 1 Down 5 Right, Kill bottom Pirate (Spear). Face Right.

- *Don't know how fight plays out if they miss a kill. Maybe retry?*

- This turn can change a lot based off speed, prioritize making sure your pirates survive. Lightning Force Bead is for either Jolly or Rowdy pirate if they move up early, for Jolly to weaken his attackers. If none of pirates have moved yet, place Lightning Bead 1 Right of Andarc to give Rowdy Pirate and himself +Tile.

##### Turn 2

- **Edgar**: Kill a Pirate.
- **Andarc**: Kill last Pirate.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1

- **Millay**: Mount, 4 Up 3 Forward, up to Wind Tile 1 Up 1 Forward from Kika. Rush Fish if it's there.
- **Corselia**: 4 Forward, Breath of Ice 3 Fish.
- **Seneca**: 3 Up 1 Right, Wind Force Bead 1 right of Trishtan. **Extra move 1 left**.
- **Andarc**: Standby.
- **Kyril** Forward 1, Dying Wish. Extra move towards Kika/Millay.
- **Corselia**: Finish 3 fish with Breath of Ice

##### Turn 2
- **Andarc**: 2 Up 1 Forward onto Lightning tile, Flaming Arrow last fish. Extra move 2 Forward.
- **Seneca**: 3 Forward 1 Down, finish blue fish. Extra move 1 forward.

- Don't move past 3 Forward of furthest Wind Tile Kika placed T1. Or, alternatively, the hole above, that's 1 past the bridge at the top. This triggers the other fish to move forward. Only do this when ready.

##### Turn 3 & on
- **Bottom side**: Cohort Attack + Breath of Ice bottom front 3 fish. Finish last one with Lightning Magic + Seneca Attack. Start making sure to step on good tiles for S-rank.
- **Top side**: Once you clear out enough fish with other group start moving forward. Don't move too far though, or you risk getting Breath of Iced by far back fish.

If possible change tiles, as long as you have no element disadvantage Rush or Falcon LVL2 should 1 shot.

- **Trishtan**: 8 Forward 1 Up, Switch to Kika. Falcon Storm Thrust bottom Fish. Face down.
- **Millay**: Mount Kangacorn, 8 Forward. Rush **BOTTOM** Fish. 2 Left, Face down.
- **Seneca**: 1 Up 4 Forward, Wind Force Bead 3 Forward (This placement is really important). Top Wind should be on Kika, left on Millay.
- **Andarc**: 4 Forward 1 Up, Blazing Wall.
- **Corselia**: 3 Forward 1 Up, Breath of Ice top fish.
- **Kyril**: 5 Forward 1 Up, place Fire Tiles under fish.

##### Turn 2
- **Kika**: 2 Up 4 Left, Standby.
- **Millay**: 5 Up 5 Left, Wind Force Bead 1 Left. Even if soldier is there don't rush, Roget will most like Wind of Sleep you. Can kill him if he's far into our area, but don't pass the tile Millay would end up on here.
- **Other 4**: Kill fish, try to move to right. Doesn't really matter, don't worry about keeping any of bottom 4 alive.

##### Turn 3
- **Kika**: 4 Left 2 Up, Kill soldier blocking Millay.
- **Millay**: Rush Roget, GG
- *Roget can Wind of Sleep Millay T2, although I think only with side of it. If she falls asleep improvise.*

> Consider going for Andarc Berserk Blow + Kyril Earth Bead on one of soldiers instead of Breath of Ice open.
> Had 1 practice where mage Thunder Runner'd Millay and Red Soldier hit her after, killing her.

Positions don't matter much, want people in certain quadrants.
Kangacorn riders bottom left quadrant, others top right quadrant.

#### Strategy
**DON'T EVER STAND ON FIRE TILES!**

##### Turn 1
- **Millay**: Go to Wind Elemental's right side (where it was if it moved), **DISMOUNT**, attack to kill it.
- **Corselia**: Start casting Blazing Wall.
- **Kyril**: Water Bead Corselia.
- **Kangacorn Riders**: Mount Kangacorn, go to places to place tiles, switch to Kika / Seneca and Rage Force Bead.
   - You should generally only need 2, the third is a backup. If you still can't cover all enemies, focus on the ones more to the right. You can kill one with Millay as a backup next turn.
- **Eugene**: Switch to **Andarc**, Blazing Wall

##### Turn 2
- **Mages**: Cast Blazing Wall again.
- **Millay**: Mount, Move 2 behind between where Seneca & Kika will be.
- **Seneca & Kika**: Move to 1 left/right center of rock, 2 below it's start. For reference, it's 3 up from Kyril's / top right starting tile. Each use Flame Force 2 infront of their position. Center of rock is same column as Mercenary Leader.
- **Kyril**: Move towards Seneca & Kika, Wind Force to get tile between them.
   - This can maybe be skipped if they face towards middle, to make Leader step on Fire tile. Can also be skipped if the leader went toward's a side, not straight down middle. Actually maybe always make them face middle and Wind Force between them.

##### Turn 3
- Millay kill any remaining units, should just be Fire Mage.

Fast 1&2 positions can be swapped.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
- **Millay**: 6 Forward 1 Right
- **Fast #1**: Standard Simeon
- **Fredrica**: 7 Forward 1 Left, Rage Force Bead 3 Right on front soldier.
- **Fast #2**: Move behind Simeon, Switch to Pablo. Fierce Wind Fangs the 4 soldiers. **Face Right**.
- **Seneca**: Switch to Ameria. 2 Right 5 Up (Center Fire Tile).
- **Trishtan**: Mount White Owl, 8 Forward.
- **Corselia**: Forward Max, Explosion. Extra move 5 forward.
- **Kyril**: 3 Up 3 Right, Cyclone Sword 1 below Ameria.

##### Turn 2
- **Archer action plays a big role in this turn. If he doesn't move up and die to Explosion, you need to kill 3 more units after Explosion to spawn last group. In this scenario, don't swap Trishtan for Seneca to kill mages. Kills should be:**
 > Need to reconsider kills here.
    1. **Kyril**: Water Mage
    2. **Simeon**: Officer
    3. **T3 Millay**: A Soldier, preferably not on Earth tile (so Kika can kill that one).
- **DO NOT PASS LINE FOR ENEMY AGGRO TRIGGER. AKA DO NOT PASS MILLAY**.
- If the archer did move into Explosion range, feel free to just go nuts here! But you need to leave 1 Lightning Soldier alive till Millay's next turn!
- **Millay**: Mount Kangacorn, 2 Right 6 Forward (2 right of Corselia). Mother Earth Bead on self. Face up.
- *If Archer stayed behind and Mother Earth Bead'd, Kill him and move to tile where Officer and left Soldier can hit you.*
- *Both groups of back soldiers should spawn now.*
- **Fredrica**: Move behind Millay. Fredrica does whatever is needed here, can kill, bead, or standby. **Face Right**.
- **Trishtan**: Move to left of Millay, **Dismount**.
- **Ameria**: Mount Owl, move near soldier / Officer. Switch to Kika and kill with Falcon Thrust. **DO NOT PASS LINE FOR AGGRO.**
- **Simeon**: Move 5 Forward / 1 Left 4 Forward, Standby / Flaming Arrow if needed. (Can still cast Breath of Ice intime next turn with Flowing Robe equipped.)
- **Kyril**: Kill Water Mage, should be from side with Swallow on Wind Tile.
- **Pablo**: Standby.

##### Turn 3
 > Don't want to kill last of group of 3 Lightning Soldiers till all the new groups have had their turns, killing too early causes them to move. Kika will likely be the one to finish him.
 > Be mindful of positioning for your own Explosion, so your important characters don't get hit.

- **Millay**: Kill lightning soldier that isn't on Earth Tile. Extra move towards right side, make sure to not be in Simeon's Breath of Ice zone.
- **Fredrica**: Kill lightning soldier or mage.
- **Corselia**: Forward Max, Explosion. Need to hit at least Captain and Archer, any others are bonus.
- **Kika**: Kill something if possible, else move towards enemies.
- **Trishtan**: Forward Max, switch to Andarc / someone with Lightning Bead / Lightning Force / Thunder Runner. Place Lightning tiles on back 3 Water group.
- **Simeon**: Move forward, Breath of Ice 2 Lightning Soldiers and hopefully mage too.
- **Kyril**: Go for mages.
- **Pablo**: Berserk Blow for turn count.

##### Turn 4
- **Millay**: Finish what should be last unit.
- If any left cleanup, be mindful of Martin's unit and important unit's position.

#### Information
Both spawns are based off unit kills.

### Mido Plains (Martin Duel)
#### Martin LVL3 strat:
1. 2 Back, Swallow, 4 Back
2. Swallow, 2 Back 3 Right
3. Swallow, 2 Right 3 Up
4. 1 Down 2 Left, Swallow. 3 Down towards wall.
5. Swallow

##### No LVL3
- If you will level up off a Swallow hit. T1 move up left, Swallow, move to wall. Face away from wall. Next turn finish with Swallow / back attack.
- If you won't level, move to wall so he can reach you from 2 side. Wind Force to your side that he can't reach, and face towards side with no Wind Tiles. He should attack you next to Wind Tile, and you attack him next turn from that Wind Tile. Accuracy is an issue.

- **Paula**: Switch to Simeon. Start casting Explosion. Kill 4 Fish.

> Note that if Roget will get the Shredding off, you can Blazing Wall if it's after Roget's turn but before Millay's. He will trigger the spawns with his own Shredding.

##### Turn 5
- *Sometimes Roget get's Shredding off before Millay's turn. Should still be okay, she should survive. Might need to cleanup 1 fish after Blazing Walls. If so, switch Jewel to Kika.*
- **Fast #1**: 5 Forward 1 Up (between 2 right fish). Rage Bead 3 Up (2 above right fish). Extra Move 3 Right.
- **Millay**: Move to Fire tile on Roget's right, Rush to kill. Make sure you don't end turn on Fire tile, wind is fine. If things went wrong can switch to Kika too.
- **Corselia & Simeon**: Finish Blazing Wall cast.

#### Information
Even if you kill the 3 fish and Roget at the same time, the rest will still spawn.

#### Notes
Moving Millay out of Shredding range doesn't work, he Cyclone Forces the fish instead.

- Normal Kangacorn should be fine, I tested with 60SPD Jewel & 57SPD Ornela and it still worked out. Might be more based on Millay's speed.

##### Turn 3
- **Ornela**: Forward max twice.
- **Fast #1**: Forward **9**, switch to Millay. Mount **Red Owl**, **Giant Owl LVL2.**
- *Fast #1 moving 9 forward here shoud manipulate Iskas to move 3L1D or 2L2D. As long as he doesn't move into corner you can hit from back anyway.*

##### Turn 4
> If Millay is after Iskas, both Standby. He'll move closer and Flaming Arrow Millay.
> You then do this next turn.
- **Ornela**: Move towards Iskas, Mother Earth Bead him.
- **Millay**: Move behind Iskas, dismount, and attack to kill.

#### Information
Every point of SKL = 1% more accuracy vs Iskas (and probably in general).
Bottom Right Chest Guardian Vestment
Left Chest Hero's Armor
More units spawn after killing 7 units
Iskas is Lightning Element
Units keep Spawning 1 by one even after second phase
Rune Cannons inflict random statuses

### Fishskas
#### Setup
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Busk (RO)', x: 2, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Jewel (K)', x: 2, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Ornela (KA)', x: 2, y: 3 },
]}/>

**REMOVE CORSELIA AND SIMEON FROM FORMATION**.
Order supposed to be Ornela > Fishskas > Jewel > Busk > Eye

##### Strategy
- Ornela: 7 Right, Mother Earth Bead 4 Right under Fishskas
- Jewel: 7 Right 2 Up.Switch to Simeon & Flowing Force 1 Down 1 Right
- Busk: 8 Right behind Red Fish, Switch to Corselia. Flaming Arrow Fishskas.

### Evil Eye
##### Information
- Evil Eye has 2 damage gates, at 33% & 66%. After each one it will back away and start charging. First unlocks it's column attack. After 2nd charge it does the big nuke.
- It does physical damage with its bunch of beams attack.

##### Strategy
 1. 1 Forward, Cyclone Force 4 Forward
 2. 3 Forward, Swallow LVL3. Extra move 1 more forward, to center Wind tile. Eye should move away now.
 3. Standby, face towards it.
 4. Move behind it, Swallow LVL3 for kill.

Final Textbox is Corselia ""Kyril... Kyril!!"

## General Information
#### Counterattack
Can counter when hit
Probability reduced by enemy Bull's Eye.
25%/50% penalty to counter attack & avoidance when hit from side/back.
Can reduce penalty with Mind's Eye.

#### Mounts
Kangacorns: +3 MOV, JMP = 1
Normal kangacorn: +50% STR, +10% SPD... -30% EVA
Armored Kangacorn: +50% STR, +30% PDF... -30% EVA
Useable by 1h sword, spear and missile weapon users.

Owls: +2 MOV, JMP = 4 (dunno if that has any effect for the owls)
Red/Blue Giant Owl: +30% STR, +30% EVA, +30% SPD... -30% PDF
White Giant Owl (Armored): +30% STR, +30% EVA... -10% PDF
Useable by 1h sword, spear, and most archers (not Seneca). Archers have their range increased by 1 while on an owl.

#### Coops
kfcrispy: i don't know the coop damage formula, but they definitely don't use Battle Lust. perhaps they use raw stats (affected by terrain) and the base power like a spell

Can maybe test via editing stats.
+ATK (Seared Bonito) doesn't increase damage
Enemy Tile very slightly affects damage? (Went from 123 to 130 in test, going from positive to neutral)
Positive tile for allies slightly affects damage (Neutral tile Kyril 123, pos tile Kyril 133)

#### Items
Puffered Fish Sashimi doesn't raise M.ATK?

#### Firefly
If Enemies can't hit Eugene normally, but can hurt him by placing tiles they will place tiles.

#### Current Ideas
Post Obel can do sharpen / shop in Illuya instead of Nay.
Benefits:
- Has Rune Shop, early Gale potentially
- Potential tier 2 beads in bargains
- Crab Bun
Downsides:
- No Seared Bonito

#### Ranking
http://suikosource.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5022&sid=6a16db4f67d1fabdf82b6b494eeb3511&start=45#p155223
##### Criteria explanation
Turn amount: number of actions made regardless of foe or friend (!!!)
Total damage: The total damage all allies (excluding NPCs) received
Damage rate: The average damage dealt to enemies from attacks (including runes)
Positive element count: The number of times your allies (excluding NPCs) end a turn on positive element
Total value of received experience: self-explaining

##### Numeric values to determine the rank
STEP1 Determining the rank for each criteria
• Turn amount & total damage
S: base value +0%
A: base value +30%
B: base value +80%
C: above
• Damage rate & positive element count & total experience value
S: base value -0%
A: base value -30%
B: base value -80%
C: below
- Each stage has different base values (?) [Look at the sheet that KFCrispy shared some posts ago]
- [I don’t understand the first sentence] A missed attack is counted as an attack that did 0 damage
- [Not sure but it seems…] The base value for experience is 500 per enemy.
STEP2 For each of the 5 criteria you’ll get a score depending on the rank you achieved in each criteria
S: 0 A: 10 B: 30 C: 60
STEP3 These scores are used to calculate an average score that will finally determine the stage rank
S: less than 5 A: less than 13 B: less than 31 C: 31 or more
[-> it means you can A rank in 2 criteria as long as you S rank the remaining 3, because you would get 10+10+0+0+0=10 -> 20/5=4 -> S rank! If you B rank in any criteria there's no chance of getting stage rank S!]

#### Eugene days
Based off day in Obel.

Water Day: Move to Illuya, then Na-Nal
Wind Day: Na-Nal, Illuya, Na-Nal
Lightning: Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Fire: Illuya, Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Earth: Na-Nal

#### Legacy Graska 2
#### Setup
Backline formation doesn't matter except Kyril.
Middle front should be slower of Jewel / Paula.
Assuming Jewel is faster, adjust accordingly.
Speedwise ideally it's Ornela, Fredrica/Millay, Jewel, Paula.
Can adjust with mounts and/or Godspeed Anklets.
Want Paula to be 39SPD or more.
Ornela & Millay on Kangacorns.

##### Requirements
Fredrica: Rage/Fire Bead
Millay: Earth/Mother Earth Bead
Ornela: Cyclone Force Bead

Formation

Busk Kyril Simeon -
Millay Fredrica Paula Jewel Ornela

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Ornela: 7D (Even with back Red Soldiers)b, Cyclone Force Bead. Ideally on front guy in second group, but if Earth/Fire already set tile in front of Ornela works. Important part is to get Wind tile infront of front Blue Spearman.
Millay: 9D1R, Earth Force Bead middle spearman / Mother Earth Force tile below middle spearman.
Fredrica: Mount if not mounted, move next to front red swordsman and Fire Tile middle / Rage tile front.
Jewel: 8D1L, behind back red swordsman. Swap to Lino & Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Spearman.
Paula: 9D, swap to Seneca and Hawk LVL3. Should kill 6. Ideally front 8 are dead here.

Simeon: move up and Breath of Ice Ogre Breath (Left Chest)
Busk: move up
Kyril: move down

##### Turn 2
Simeon: Flowing Force Bead center column, 3 north of chest. Can move cursor to chest, move left to middle, then up 3.
Busk: move up (not into water).
Fredrica: move down, swap to Kika and kill something.
Rest: keep moving down and killing stuff. Be careful with Millay. Unit deaths don't matter but permadeath does.

##### Turn 3 & on.
Simeon move into front water tile.
When top soldiers spawn Breath of Ice middle 2. Busk gets on owl and kills right one.
Rest keep doing same thing.


### Haruna Previous
#### Setup
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Trishtan (K)', x: 1, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Kyril', x: 1, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Gretchen', x: 1, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Andarc', x: 1, y: 3 },
  { name: 'Eugene', x: 0, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Ameria', x: 0, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Jeremy', x: 0, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Pablo', x: 0, y: 3 },
]}/>

Note: Pablo is assumed to be slowest character here, doesn't have to be Pablo but you need someone slower than everyone else here.
Most slots are interchangable as well. Only important ones should be Kyril & Trishtan. The 4 Kangacorn riders are interchangable.

##### Beads
- Seneca: Wind x2
- Kika: Wind x2
- Flare: Flame, (Cyclone Sword)

![Turn 1 Setup](../../images/Suikoden/Tactics/HarunaT1Setup.png)

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1

##### Turn 2
- **Trishtan**: Move to left of Kika, switch to Gary. Backup center Wind Tile to buff 4 characters.
- **Kika**: Move towards Archers, Falcon Thrust Archer that Millay can't rush for extra movement. Move back/left 1 tile with Extra Move.
- *You move back here incase the Officer gets 2 turns in a row, keeps Kika out of range of him.*
- **Kyril**: 3 Right 2 Down, Flying Swallow down to kill Archer. Extra move 1 up. **If Flare is before Officer face up or down.**
- **Seneca**: 1 Down 2 Right, Wind Bead on self.

- **Flare**: Kill mage if survivors, else Standby on Water tile.

##### Turn 4
- Top side changes depending on turn order. If Millay can reach the mage, go for the kill on the mage. If not, Kill 2 closest and Extra Move out of range. Kika its 5 back, Millay it's 1 up 1 left of Kika. Be mindful of archer getting double turn if killing mage. Also, Kika won't kill the Soldier without elemental advantage.
- Bottom half kills rest, chills.

##### Turn 5
- Top side finishes remaining 2 units.
