### The Night Sea #2

 - *Don't know how fight plays out if they miss a kill. Maybe retry?*
 - **Andarc**: 3 Right 2 Up, Thunder Runner Pirate in front of Rowdy Pirate (Lightning Elemental). He should be able to tank the hit, and it will give him +Tile while giving enemy pirates -Tile.

##### Turn 2
 - **Brandeau**: Move behind Pirate that placed Water Tiles and kill him.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Andarc 2 Right, birds can go in front or behind him
Kyril kill bird not on bridge
Seneca + Andarc kill other bird
Won't Always go smoothly, improvise.
Want to talk to unlock Cohort & Dying Wish
Can use Thunder Runner & probably Cohort
Break through to second rock, break it.
Move Kyril to bottom right spot (in front of rock) **don't go into further half or enemies spawn.**
Move Andarc & Seneca as close as possible. Wait for Kyril's turn and standby.
Next person after Kyril moves up to a spot on the left where they can get hit from all directions and puts down a Lightning tile on themselves.
Other person does same.
Kyril moves straight up and standbys.
Goal is to bait units away from path so Kyril can cut through.


## The Evil Eye
### Underground Passage 2
#### Setup
Remove Medals from Kyril, attach as many as possible to Seneca, then Andarc.

#### Information
2 Left Bats Earth Water
3 Middle Skeletons w/ Sword 2 Wind 1 Lightning
Right Bat Wind, Right Skeleton w/ Bow Wind, Fire Elemental
Back Group: Skeleton Sword Fire, 2 Skeleton Bow Fire Lightning

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Andarc Flame Force Bead up as much as possible
Seneca run to bottom right corner
Kyril move up and kill stuff. T1 Attack right bird & face left to try to bait Skele onto right fire tile.
If Kyril is short damage can use Seneca to finish off bird T1, but don't risk it T2.

##### Turn 2
Use Seneca & Andarc to kill stuff when safe, focus on moving up.
Try to kill right Fire Skele with Thunder Runner.

Second group of units dont move until you move above the bridge.
Play slow and safe.

#### Other Info
Left Chest: Flame Force Bead x3
Top Chest: Salad x5
Getting either chest spawns a skeleton
One Skele drops Chain Mail.
You can use Extra Move to hit hit skele and move back out of trigger. Only hit skeleton will move.
Soloing with Kyril is actually viable here, don't know if faster though.
Medicine heals Skeletons :(

Want to equip the Chain Mail to Kyril at some point, even if just to sell for more money.

##### Beads
 - Trishtan: Fire, Water
 - Flare: Fire
 - One of Seneca, Andarc, Kyril: Fire

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Trishtan**: Forward max, place Fire Bead to the right of the archer.
 - **Flare**: move forward max and kill the archer.
 - **Kika**: move up max
 - **Seneca**: move up max
 - **Andarc**: move forward 5, next to Seneca.
 - **Kyril**: move forward max
 - *Wind Archer and soldier will move onto Fire tiles and attack Flare.*
 - **Maxine**: move forward max, kill Wind Soldier with Flaming Arrow.

##### Turn 2
 - **Trishtan**: move in front of Fire Soldier, place Water Bead under him
 - **Kika**: move behind archer and kill it
 - **Seneca**: 1 left forward max, kill Fire Soldier on Water Tile.
 - **Flare**: Move to front Water Tile, place Flame Bead 1 right of Wind Mage on left. Exact position doesn't matter.
 - **Andarc**: Move forward max, Thunder Runner Wind Mage to kill
 - **Kyril**: Forward max, Swallow Rune for damage if possible.
 - **Maxine**: Forward max if you can reach someone with Flaming Arrows, else Forward 4 to stay on Fire tile.

##### Turn 3
 - If units are too far away, just wait for them to come to you. If they moved forward on right side it's fine to attack now. You don't want to attack them near middle because it will pull other enemies towards the right.
 - Have Flare or Maxine break the chest on the right to get the Wing Mail. It doesn't need to be rushed, you'll have time as you chase the last mage.
 - Setup for Dying Wish, you want Kyril 1 tile below 1 tile right of the box. Have someone place a Fire tile below Kyril to kill Busk.

##### Beads
 - Trishtan: Fire
 - Seneca: Lightning
 - Flare: Water (optional)

##### Skills
 - Kika: Jump, Extra Move

#### Strategy

> Final Version: Use Cohort T3 to take out Roget & 2 Fish that Spawn from your side above them.
> Seneca & Andarc have exactly enough movement to reach the required spot, so make sure they're path is always cleard.
> Because Trishtan needs to start further back, he needs Godspeed.
> Extra Move on Seneca. Andarc, and Kika helps a ton here.
> T1/2 Flare takes out Blue Fish,

##### Turn 1
 - Trishtan: 6 Down 1 Left, Rush Orange Fish **(NOT RED FISH)**
 - Kika: 5 Down, Attack / Falcon Slash Red Fish. Extra move 1 Left or 1 Down.
 - Flare: 1 Left 4 Up
 - Seneca: 2 Left 3 Down, Lightning Force Bead tile to her right.
 - Andarc: 3 Left 2 Down, Try to place Lightning Tiles under fish, can Thunder Runner if it would kill something.
 - Kyril: 1 Right Max Up, Attack Bowman if you can.

##### Turn 2
 - Flare: Move out of range of Red Fish
Trishtan kill one of center ones, leave top one for Kika
Kyril move towards Kika & Trishtan and Cyclone Sword any water panels.
Other 3 take out the ones on hill.

Use Akaghi & Kyril to put Flame Tiles under Roget.

> (Worse than Cohort strat, but depending on Cohort cooldown might be necessary?) With Jump & Extra Move (almost certainly need jump, possibly don't need Extra Move) Kika can reach Roget Turn 3. If you put a Fire Tile below him T3 with Trishtan and Falcon Thrust with Kika from a Wind Tile you one shot him. Probably best strat for the fight, need to work out details. In attempt he tried to Wind of Sleep Kika, need to figure out way to deal with that if he hits sleep.

#### Information

Trishtan mounted, make sure Mizuki has Water Bead and Medicine (starting items)
Trishtan should have a Wind Force Bead.
Also consider using Wendel instead of Mizuki, she's a little faster. Might be too fast though?

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Trishtan**: move forward, unmount
 - **Millay** **Mount**, move all the way up, **Switch to Kika**. Seared Bonito self.
 - **Mizuki**: move forward, Medicine (to slow her down, want her after Martin)

##### Turn 2
 - **Trishtan**: Mount, move forward right above rock. Front should be facing Martin, rock left, empty right and back. Wind Force Bead tile in front of self.
 - **Mizuki**: If Martin moved already move up and put Water bead under him. If not, switch to Seneca and put Wind Panels on tiles we'd be attacking Martin from.
 - **Kika**: Falcon Slash Martin, preferably from back. Use extra move to move out of his way so Kyril can Swallow Rune.
 - **Kyril**: Move up and attack / Swallow.

If not dead and Trishtan outspeeds can switch to Andarc and Thunder Runner.

Once you clear out enough fish with other group start moving forward. Don't move too far though, or you risk getting Breath of Iced by far back fish.

3 Fish spawn in that are Lightning Element

##### Beads
 - **Trishtan**: Wind

#### Information
 - Back 5 don't move unless you cross line or kill all other bandits or damage them

 - Can place Wind Tile where Yellow Mercenary will attack from, he will move onto it if he can hit someone.

 - **Kika**: 2 Left 4 Up, Attack/Falcon backmost Bandit.
 - **Millay**: 6 Left 4 Up, Rush closest Bandit.
 - **Seneca**: 1 Left 4 Up, Strong Arm middle Bandit.

> Note Seneca's current position. This is middle of grid of safe spots from when Mercs move up. Before you kill last Bandit, you want to make sure that no one is past Seneca. They can be 1 tile more forward for every tile to the side.

 - **Corselia**: 2 Up 2 Left, Water Force in front of her so 2 Fire Bandits are on Water Tiles.
 - **Andarc**: 4 Up 1 Left, Berserk Blow 1 of 2 Fire Bandits. Go for right if Kika countered left. Standby after Berserk Blow.
 - **Kyril**: If you can kill left bandit kill him from behind, if not kill right from behind.

 - **Kika**: Move up and Falcon Storm Thrust close Water Bandit, then move back to Wind Tile.
 - **Millay**: Rush a Bandit, back to your area.

 - **Corselia**: Water Force Fire Bandit if needed, move back towards middle. If possible set up Water Tile for self for Breath of Ice. Want her position for Breath of Ice to be 1 behind Seneca's future position.
 - **Kyril/Andarc**: Try to kill a Bandit.
 - Should generally be one Bandit left alive.

##### Turn 3
 - Start setting up for the Mercenary kill. Kill remaining Bandits if turn order allows.
 - Move people into proper positions, have Corselia start casting Breath of Ice if the time it will go off makes sense, if not place Water Tile where Corselia will be.
 - Position Seneca & Andarc for Cohort.
 - Rest place tiles, make sure to be in safe spots that won't mess with AI's movement.

##### Turn 4
 - **Millay**: Rush & Kill Mercenary Leader, back up again with Extra Move.

> Ice Crush with -Tile for Officer: Kills with +Kyril&Corselia, +Corselia&Kyril. Based off damage Corselia&Kyril should work fine.

##### Turn 1
 - **Trishtan**: Swap to Gary, Backup on Millay. Need to figure out what to do with him later in fight. Switching to Flare is valid, then later Ema for tile placement.
 - Switching in Flare and using her to clear soldiers by Simeon is valid.
 - **Millay**: Mount Kangacorn. 1 Up 7 Right, Rush bottom-left Swordsman. Move 2 Left, face right.
 - **Kika**: 1 Up 5 Right, Falcon Thrust closest Swordsman. Face up.
 - **Seneca**: 4 Right 1 Down, Lightning Force Bead 1 left (so middle tile of bridge only is lightning)
 - **Andarc**: 1 Up 3 Right, Berserk Blow Swordsman that should now be below Kika. Extra move to Lightning tile from Berserk Blow.
 - *If no Berserk Blow, Thunder Runner and use SoC lvl3 to get Wind tile under Kika. Finish with Sene
ca T2.*
 - **Corselia**: 2 Up 3 Right, Breath of Ice the 3 Soldiers on the top side. Extra Move 1 Right 2 Down.

 - **Kyril**: 1 Down, talk to Corselia. Extra move 1 Up 2 Right, to where Millay was T1.
 - **Corselia**: Either Breath of Ice 3 Soldiers with Simeon, or move behind Kyril and place Wind Tile 1 above Kyril. Preferable Breath of Ice.
 - **Andarc**: Place Flame Force Bead above Officer after he attacks Kyril. If he hasn't yet Standby or place Lightning Tiles a bit further ahead for later.
 - *You don't want to move past Kyril till the Officer is dead. If he can reach the tile below Kyril, don't move there either.

##### Turn 3
 - **Millay**: 7 Right 1 Down, behind Officer. Rush to kill. Extra Move 1 Up 1 Left.
 - **Kika**: 3 Up 3 Right, Wind Force Bead 1 Right (on Millay).
 - **Kyril**: Ice Crush Co-op to kill Officer. Move 1 Down 5 Right into corner.

##### Turn 4
 - **Kika & Millay**: Kill 2 Soldiers next to Kika & Millay. Move out of Berserk Blow (5) range.

###### Turn 5
 - **Kika & Millay**: Finish last 2 units on their side.

#### Strategy
<PartyFormation formation={[

  { name: 'Andarc', x: 4, y: 3 },
]}/>

Andarc's only job is to be slower than 3 Lightning guys, can be done by anyone. Too slow is probably bad though. They have around 27 speed.

##### Beads
 - Kyril: Thunder, Mother Earth
 - Millay: Cyclone, Wind or Healing Item

#### Strategy (New)
##### Turn 1
 - **Andarc**: Switch to Millay, Mount, 4 Right 2 Up, Rush Soldier by Wall. Extra Move 4 Up face down.
 - **Kyril**: 1 Up, Thunder Force Bead 4 Up, Extra Move 2 Down 2 Right.

##### Turn 2
 - **Kyril**: Standby
 - **Millay**: 1 Up 1 Right, Rush Soldier from top. 5 Right 1 Up.

##### Turn 3
 - **Kyril**: 5 Left, Mother Earth Bead 4 Up.
 - **Millay**: 9 Up (top right corner), **DISMOUNT**. If after Kyril T3 and healthy can Standby, else Heal / Bead self.

##### Turn 4
Take note of who's faster between Paula and Jewel.

 - **Paula**: Fly behind left cannon, **DISMOUNT**, attack and hopefully kill (range).
 - **Jewel**: Fly to left cannon, kill it.
 - **Kyril**: Kill left cannon with Swallow LVL1 if it survived, else just sit in corner.
 - **Selma**: Sit in corner rest of fight.
 - **Millay**: Mount Red Owl, 9 Up, Cyclone Force Bead 1 Up 1 Left (bottom right corner of cannon)

##### Turn 5
Everyone but Millay does nothing from now on.

 - **Millay**: Dismount, 3 Up 1 Left (onto Wind Tile), Attack and kill Cannon. Extra Move 1 Right 2 Up, behind Chest. (This seems to prevent Cannon attack)

##### Turn 6
 - **Millay**: **Mount**, 1 Up 6 Left, Rush Cannon from top-left.

##### Turn 7
 - **Millay**: Rush final Cannon for Victory.

]}/>

#### Beads
 - Fast #2: Rage Force Bead
 - Seneca: Cyclone Force Bead x3, maybe Earth Bead

#### Strategy
I think for this strat to work as listed the Earth Archer needs to be fast.

##### Turn 1
 - **Fast#1**: Move to right of right soldier, switch to Simeon, Silent Lake 4 Up (get 3 mages on right).
 - **Fast#2**: Move to 2 in front of front soldier (behind where Fredrica will be), Rage Force Bead under front Soldier.
 - **Fredrica**: Move in front of front soldier, Dance of the Hawk to kill back 3.
 - **Millay**: Rush front guy from left, extra move 3 Left 1 Up.
 - **Seneca**: 1 Up 5 Right, Cyclone Force Bead tile below Millay.
 - *Enemy Archer moves left and places Mother Earth Bead.*
 - **Kika, Kyril, Corselia**: Forward Max. Have 1 Cyclone Force if Archer placed Earth tiles on us.

##### Turn 2
Treat movements more as recommendations. Final tile is what matters.

 - **Fast #2**: 1 Left 2 Back, Switch to Gary & buff Kyril & Fredrica. Move 2 Back. Standby rest of fight.
 - **Kika**: 2 Right. Cyclone Sword Soldier Right of Millay. 3 Up 1 Left.
 - Earth Soldier that didn't attack should attack Kyril from right now.
 - **Fredrica**: 3 Forward, Strong Shot Soldier 2 Left.
 - **Seneca**: 3 Forward 2 Right,  Strong Arm Soldier 3 behind. With LVL4 Weapon barely miss kill.
 - *Archer moves up and attacks Seneca here.*
 - **Corselia**: 5 Right, Flaming Arrows last Soldier if he's alive. If not, maybe Flaming Arrow Water Mage? She should always kill, might be a better fix than Seneca stats.
 - **Millay**: Rush Archer, move to center of Mother Earth panels. Face Forward. (Should be in range of officer only). Want to be below rock, 2 to the right.
 - **Simeon**: 3 Forward 2 Right, Breath of Ice all mages or the 2 non Water ones. Need to level up. If needed, use extra move for the movement. Just need to move at least 1 forward before Breath of Ice. He should be just out of range of Lightning enemies.
 - **Kyril**: 4 Right, kill Water mage. Extra move 2 Up, to where Simeon was.

##### Turn 3
 - **Fredrica**: 3 Forward 2 Left, onto closest Earth Tile. Strong Shot Officer.
 - **Kika**: 5 Up 1 Right (Order matters because of Cyclone Sword), Falcon Thrust Soldier.
 - **Seneca**: 5 Up, Cyclone Force Bead on Millay's tile (all Earth tiles).
 - **Millay**: 5 Right, Rush Spearman. Extra Move 5 left onto Wind Tile. Face up.
 - **Kyril**: 4 Up 2 Left (this seems incredible arbitrary, can probably be improved).
 - **Corselia**: 5 Up.
 - **Simeon**: 3 Forward, Silent Lake so you hit both mages. Extra move 1 Back 1 Left. Should also be adjusted.

##### Turn 4
 - **Fredrica**: Mount Owl, 8 Forward, switch to Andarc: Thunder Runner between 3 units.
 - **Seneca, Kyril, Corselia, Simeon**: Kill soldiers by Simeon.
 - **Kika**: 5 Forward 1 Right, Falcon Thrust Kangacorn Officer.
 - **Millay**: 1 Right 7 Forward, Rush Archer. Extra Move onto Wind Tile.

##### Turn 5
 - **Millay & Kika**: Finish 2 remaining mages.

#### Information
Both spawns are based off unit kills.

### Mido Plains (Martin Duel)
If he has a lvl3 skill point consider retrying, should be faster.
If he does Rage Sword LVL3 run to bottom right corner, Cyclone Sword T2. When he reaches you just move behind him and attack from back.
If he doesn't just move behind him and attack and move away. He should put down fire tiles, you move left and put Wind Tiles, he moves up and attacks, you attack him from back.

  { name: 'Simeon', x: 1, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Andarc', x: 0, y: 2 },
]}/>

#### Beads
 - Kyril: Flowing Force Bead
 - Fast #1: Flowing Force Bead
 - Andarc: Thunder Force Bead
 - Fredrica: 3 Rage Force Beads
 - Millay: 2 Rage Force Beads

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Millay / Fast #1**: Place Water Force Bead above Simeon, 9 Up. Other just 9 Up.
 - **Simeon**: Start casting Breath of Ice. Should finish cast once 4 fish are close.
 - **Andarc**: Thunder Force Bead 2 left of self, so 3/4 fish are on Lightning Tiles.
 - If you only kill 3 fish survive, improvise. Simeon can extra move away for safety. Doesn't matter if Andarc dies.
 - **Kyril**: Cyclone Sword all 3 enemy soldiers. Extra move up a bit.
 - **Corselia**: 3 Down or so, Breath of Ice all 3 Soldiers, move 2 Up face down.

##### Turn 2
 - **Simeon/Andarc**: Kill damage other fish. After all fish are dead can kill Lino & Soldiers. Can switch Andarc for Kika or anyone else needed.
 - **Owls**: 9 Forward
 - **Kyril**: Flowing Force Bead so there's 1 tile before gate for Corselia.
 - **Corselia**: Move to Water Tile, Breath of Ice mages.

##### Turn 3
 - **Fast#1**: 7 Forward 2 Right, Switch to Fredrica. If needed for range/tile mount Owl, Attack mage, probably one on -tile.
 - **Millay**: 9 Forward, dismount.
 - **Kyril**: Can kill Ornela/Busk from now on.
 - **Corselia**: Hit mages if possible (make sure you have LVL3 MP left though). Chill on Water tile.

##### Turn 4
 - **Fredrica**: Mount Owl if not mounted already, move 8 up. Rage Force Bead 2 Up 2 Right (2 below middle fish). Extra Move 1 Left.
 - **Millay**: Kill last mage if still alive, move up as much as possible.

##### Turn 5
 - **Fredrica**: 5 Up. Rage Force Bead 2 Up 2 Right (2 above left fish). Extra move 2 Down 1 Left.
 - **Millay**: Move where necessary, Rage Force Bead 2 Up 2 Left (2 above right fish). Move away from fish if within 2 tiles. Be careful if she's not full HP and close to Roget, he will probably Shredding. Better to skip Rage Force Bead in this scenario and let Fredrica do it.
 - Roget is a dick, and will probably do something annoying here.

##### Turn 6
 - **Fredrica**: Place a Rage Force Bead if needed. Else standby somewhere near bottom left barricade.
 - **Millay**: Rush Roget from Wind Tile. Extra Move onto Wind Tile.
 - **Corselia & Simeon**: Blazing Wall if it would go off after Millay's turn. Else Standby and do it next turn.

##### Turn 7
 - Blazing Walls, Fredrica kill bottom left mage if he lives.

#### Information
Even if you kill the 3 fish and Roget at the same time, the rest will still spawn.

With current setup can use Fredrica w/ Owl and Corselia FA, which both have range of 4.
Use Seneca/Corselia first, since Fredrica can in theory perma-die.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Millay**: 6 Up 1 Left, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1 Left 3 Up, face right.
 - **Ornela**: 7 Up 1 Right, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1U1R face up or right
 - **Fast #2**: 9 Up (behind Red Swordsman), switch to Simeon. Silent Lake 1 Up 3 Left - Top left corner should be on top left staff wielder. Should hit fish and all staff wielders, and put Simeon on water. Face up.
 - **Fast #1**: 8 Up, switch Kika, Falcon Thrust Red Swordsman. Face up.
 - **Busk**: Standby to speed up next turn. Want to go after Big Fish before Kika.
 - **Kyril**: Move up and kill Yellow Bowman guy. If he hasn't moved yet can just move up for potential fish backup kill or standby to kill Yellow Bowman.

##### Turn 2
 - **Millay**: Move forward, Rush someone if in the way. Can move towards front left to avoid fish magic attack.
 - **Ornela**: Move up, Rush someone further along the way if in the way. Should level up. Use extra move to move up.
 - **Kika**: Kill Fish with Falcon LVL3
 - **Kyril**: Kill a unit / nothing. Backup for fish kill if Kika dies.

##### Turn 3
 - Ornela / Millay: move up, swap to Seneca / Fredrica / Corselia and kill eyes.

#### Beads
 - Ornela: Rage Force Bead
 - Millay: Mother Earth Bead
 - Kyril: Flowing Force Bead
 - Seneca or Kyril: Wind/Cyclone Force Bead

Fredrica needs LVL7 WPN, Power Gloves, Str. Sash
Seneca needs LVL7 WPN, Power Gloves, maybe STR Sash?

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Ornela**: 7 Down **DISMOUNT** (Even with back Red Soldiers). Rage Force Bead 2 Left (Center Red Soldier)
 - **Millay**: 9 Down 1 Right, Mother Earth Bead 2 Down (Bottom Left Spearman).
 - **Fast #1**: 8 Down 1 Right, Switch to Lino. Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Soldiers (should kill both).
 - **Fast #2**: Mount Owl, 9 Down. Switch to Fredrica, Dance of the Hawk. Should kill other 6 Soldiers.
 - **Seneca**: 4 Up, attack Chest for Ogre Breath. Extra Move 1 Right.
 - **Kyril**: 6 Up, Flowing Force Bead 1 Up.
 - *From this point on the bottom part of the fight is improvised. Progress slowly, don't over extend for single kills. Units can die with the exception of Millay, who can't permadie.*
 - **Busk & Trishtan**: Mount Kangacorn, move down. Swap to someone useful and do something useful.
 - Most useful units are Simeon & Kika. Simeon with +tile will kill pretty much anything. Breath of Ice doesn't have long cast time here because Busk/Trishtan are slow. Andarc can be used to place lightning tiles, Corselia can be used for damage w/ Explosion. Her other spells don't quite oneshot, but Explosion can with her +tile.

##### Turn 2
 - **Seneca**: 4 Up. Wind Force Bead on self / Cyclone Force Bead 1 Up. Or let Kyril do it.
 - **Kyril**: 1 Up, Wind / Cyclone Bead / Cyclone Sword if Seneca didn't.
 - Seneca & Kyril wait till units spawn at top. Seneca does Dance of the Hawk, should kill everything. If not Kyril helps deal with stragglers.

#### Information.
S: Gate of Graska
Left Chest: Ogre Breath
Right Chest: Guardian Vestment
8 Kills to spawn first extra group. All bowmen, middle 2 water side 2 earth.
2 more kills spawn next 4. Middle column 2 water, sides 2 lightning. Front guy Swordsman, rest mages.

Depart > Secret Facility

### Iskas
#### Strategy New
##### Equipment
Remove Mother Earth Armor and Ogre Breath from Ornela, make sure she has 1 Mother Earth Force Bead
Give Kika Mother Earth Armor & Ogre Breath

##### Speed
Want fastest of Paula/Jewel/Fredrica, but slower than Ornela & Millay.

##### Formation
|   |        |              |        |
|---|--------|--------------|--------|
| - | Millay | Speed Person | Ornela |
| - |    -   |      -       |   -    |
|   |    -   |      -       |        |

#### Strategy (Old)
Want Mother Earth Armor and beads on Millay and Ornela
Start them on 2 top right tiles with Owls. Go right, and book it towards Iskas. You can use Rush on the chest for a little boost.
Switch to Kangacorns for 1 extra MOV

When you get in range, 1st one Mother Earth Beads Iskas
Second one gets best angle possible and attacks.
If you can't attack before element change / movement, reapply Mother Earth

Other end of the fight just want to stall. Can kill a lot of them, but if you kill too many more will spawn.
Silent Lake with Simeon T1 is really good, he'll probably die for it but it's worth. Wind of Sleep is also really useful here.

Can try 3 Person party, with Kyril, Millay, and Ornela. Kyril hides in corner, Ornela and Millay rush right side.
If so, probably need better defensive equipment for Kyril, perhaps consumable +DEF item. Ornela gets beat up too, consider same for her. Millay can maybe use +ATK consumable item. Also, Rush doesn't work on Iskas.

#### Information
Every point of SKL = 1% more accuracy vs Iskas (and probably in general).
Bottom Right Chest Guardian Vestment
Left Chest Hero's Armor
More units spawn after killing a certain amount
Iskas is Lightning Element
Units keep Spawning 1 by one even after second phase
Rune Cannons inflict random statuses
Kika w/ Bull's Eye is most reliable option. Plus you can set her up ahead of time for Fishskas.

### Fishskas
##### Strategy (New)
Move Ornela 8U1R, Mother Earth Bead under Iskas so there's 1 tile in front him that's Earth too
Millay move up to side of fish, Rush.
Paula Mount Kangacorn, move up 10, switch to Kika and Falcon Storm Thrust for kill.

Setup is Millay and Ornela on Owls on right side, Fredrica & Jewel (or any 2 somewhat fast people that can use owls) in Center Middle.
You want Millay or Ornela (whoever is putting Earth tile) to be faster than Fishskas. Other one has to be faster than remaining 2.
Jewel & Fredrica need to both be faster or slower than Fishskas. Can't have 1 of each. Should always be slower.

#### Information
Every 1 STR on Kika is about 10 damage.

### Evil Eye
Basically Cyclone Sword, wait for it to get closer, then LVL3 Swallow from behind.
Might take a few hits.

It does physical damage with its bunch of beams attack.

Final Textbox is Corsela ""Kyril... Kyril!!"



## General Information
#### Counterattack
Can counter when hit
Probability reduced by enemy Bull's Eye.
25%/50% penalty to counter attack & avoidance when hit from side/back.
Can reduce penalty with Mind's Eye.

#### Mounts
Kangacorns: +3 MOV, JMP = 1
Normal kangacorn: +50% STR, +10% SPD... -30% EVA
Armored Kangacorn: +50% STR, +30% PDF... -30% EVA
Useable by 1h sword, spear and missile weapon users.

Owls: +2 MOV, JMP = 4 (dunno if that has any effect for the owls)
Red/Blue Giant Owl: +30% STR, +30% EVA, +30% SPD... -30% PDF
White Giant Owl (Armored): +30% STR, +30% EVA... -10% PDF
Useable by 1h sword, spear, and most archers (not Seneca). Archers have their range increased by 1 while on an owl.

#### Coops
kfcrispy: i don't know the coop damage formula, but they definitely don't use Battle Lust. perhaps they use raw stats (affected by terrain) and the base power like a spell

Can maybe test via editing stats.
+ATK (Seared Bonito) doesn't increase damage
Enemy Tile very slightly affects damage? (Went from 123 to 130 in test, going from positive to neutral)
Positive tile for allies slightly affects damage (Neutral tile Kyril 123, pos tile Kyril 133)

#### Items
Puffered Fish Sashimi doesn't raise M.ATK?

#### Firefly
If Enemies can't hit Eugene normally, but can hurt him by placing tiles they will place tiles.

#### Current Ideas
Skip Eugene, get Maxine & Pablo
Maybe spec Flare a bit, Maxine and Flare will be used for El-Eal > Calleron Laboratory.
Considering specing out Akaghi a little bit too for both El-Eal battles and Callonbal 1.
Keep Thunder God Garb on Seneca, at least until after Caleron Lab. She's mostly with Andarc up to that point.

Post Obel can do sharpen / shop in Illuya instead of Nay.
Benefits:
 * Has Rune Shop, early Gale potentially
 * Potential tier 2 beads in bargains
 * Crab Bun
Downsides:
 * No Seared Bonito

#### Ranking

##### Criteria explanation
Turn amount: number of actions made regardless of foe or friend (!!!)
Total damage: The total damage all allies (excluding NPCs) received
Damage rate: The average damage dealt to enemies from attacks (including runes)
Positive element count: The number of times your allies (excluding NPCs) end a turn on positive element
Total value of received experience: self-explaining

##### Numeric values to determine the rank
STEP1 Determining the rank for each criteria
• Turn amount & total damage
S: base value +0%
A: base value +30%
B: base value +80%
C: above
• Damage rate & positive element count & total experience value
S: base value -0%
A: base value -30%
B: base value -80%
C: below
- Each stage has different base values (?) [Look at the sheet that KFCrispy shared some posts ago]
- [I don’t understand the first sentence] A missed attack is counted as an attack that did 0 damage
- [Not sure but it seems…] The base value for experience is 500 per enemy.
STEP2 For each of the 5 criteria you’ll get a score depending on the rank you achieved in each criteria
S: 0 A: 10 B: 30 C: 60
STEP3 These scores are used to calculate an average score that will finally determine the stage rank
S: less than 5 A: less than 13 B: less than 31 C: 31 or more
[-> it means you can A rank in 2 criteria as long as you S rank the remaining 3, because you would get 10+10+0+0+0=10 -> 20/5=4 -> S rank! If you B rank in any criteria there's no chance of getting stage rank S!]
