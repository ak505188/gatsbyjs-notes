### Starting Stat Manipulation
This game has a very easy way to manipulate starting stats for all your characters.
Simply reset the console, and hit New Game to get seed 0. Back out, and hit new game again to get seed 1, etc.
Load game works as well.

We are going to use Seed 15, RNG 0x71798ad5 post calculation. 

**To do this, press New Game / Load Game and back out 15 times. Then press New Game, pick your settings, and start the run.**

To confirm correct seed:
- Lazlo HP: 21
- Snowe HP: 22

### Intro Battle
Say no to tutorial

- **Lazlo**: 1 Forward (east)
- **Snowe**: 1 Down 1 Forward
- **Lazlo**: 1 Down, attack
- **Snowe**: 1 Forward, attack

### Intro Battle 2
> Really don't want Kyril to level, Battle at Sea gets way tighter.

Too much variance for set strat. Kill Elemental ASAP, move units towards right. Kyril can bait by moving forward and placing Flame Force Bead on self. Kill left once they get closer.

- *If 1st failed to kill, move 2 Left 1 Up of 1st person, face forward.*

### The Night Sea #2
> If you finish kill all other Pirates before Kyril's 3rd turn (Fish Spawn), the battle ends.
> Want Andarc LVL2 preferably, so he is slower than Pirates. That way he can Thunder Runner a Pirate.

#### Setup
#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
- **Brandeau**: 1 Down 5 Right, Kill bottom Pirate (Spear). Face Right.

- *Don't know how fight plays out if they miss a kill. Maybe retry?*
- **Andarc**: 3 Right 2 Up, Thunder Runner a Pirate. Face away from enemies.
- *Usually if an enemy has a turn left and there's a Pirate near Edgar aim for that one. Next Pirate will move onto Lightning Tile and Jolly + Rowdy probably kill.*

##### Turn 2
> If Jolly or Rowdy got hit twice, you want to Medicine them with Edgar. If Edgar got stunned, can do it with Brandeau instead. BUT ONLY if Jolly + Rowdy will kill an enemy Pirate.
> Want to aim for the Pirates closer to Steele, the ones closer to you are more likely to target Andarc & Peck. But keep in mind Brandeau's range for his 3rd turn.

- **Brandeau**: Move behind Pirate that placed Water Tiles and kill him.
- **Edgar**: Kill a Pirate closer to Steele / Medicine **WITHOUT MOVING** ally if viable. If no movement he gets a 3rd turn.

Positions don't matter much, want people in certain quadrants.
Kangacorn riders bottom left quadrant, others top right quadrant.

#### Strategy
**DON'T EVER STAND ON FIRE TILES!**

##### Turn 1
- **Millay**: Go to Wind Elemental's right side (where it was if it moved), **DISMOUNT**, attack to kill it.
- **Corselia**: Start casting Blazing Wall.
- **Kyril**: Water Bead Corselia.
- **Kangacorn Riders**: Mount Kangacorn, go to places to place tiles, switch to Kika / Seneca and Rage Force Bead.
   - You should generally only need 2, the third is a backup. If you still can't cover all enemies, focus on the ones more to the right. You can kill one with Millay as a backup next turn.
   - Can swap to **Ema** for 3rd bead.
- **Wendel**: Switch to **Andarc**, Blazing Wall
- **Pablo**: Switch to Flare, Lightning Force for Andarc.

##### Turn 2
- **Mages**: Cast Blazing Wall again.
- **Millay**: Mount, Move 2 behind between where Seneca & Kika will be.
- **Seneca & Kika**: Move to 1 left/right center of rock, 2 below it's start. For reference, it's 3 up from Kyril's / top right starting tile. Each use Flame Force 2 infront of their position. Center of rock is same column as Mercenary Leader.
- **Kyril**: Move towards Seneca & Kika, Wind Force to get tile between them.
   - This can maybe be skipped if they face towards middle, to make Leader step on Fire tile. Can also be skipped if the leader went toward's a side, not straight down middle. Actually maybe always make them face middle and Wind Force between them.

##### Turn 3
- Millay kill any remaining units, should just be Fire Mage.

- **Kyril**: 3 Up 3 Right, Cyclone Sword on Ameria.

##### Turn 2
- **DO NOT PASS LINE FOR ENEMY AGGRO TRIGGER. AKA DO NOT PASS Millay/Coselia + 1**.
- *Archer vs No Archer kill plays mostly the same. Difference is Fire Mage gets to live an extra turn.*
- **Millay**: Mount Kangacorn.
  * If Archer lived, Rush him from direction that would let you get to 2 right of Corselia (usually left). Then extra move there. Face Up.
  * If not, then move to 2 Right of Corselia, Mother Earth Bead self. Face Up.
- **Fredrica**:
  * If Archer lived Explosion, move behind Millay and Mother Earth Bead Millay. Face Right.
  * If Archer died to Explosion, kill Fire Mage and move behind Millay. Face Right.
- **Trishtan**: Move to left of Millay, **Dismount**.

- **Pablo**: Standby rest of fight.

##### Turn 3
- **Millay**: Rush Water Mage in the back from the front. Extra move 1 more Forward, face back.

- **Kika**: 1 Up 5 Right, Falcon Thrust Lightning Soldier on Water Tile.
- **Kyril**: Go for mages if any alive.

##### Turn 4
- **Millay**: Finish what should be last unit.
- If any left cleanup, be mindful of Martin's unit and important unit's position.

#### Information
Both spawns are based off unit kills.

### Mido Plains (Martin Duel)
#### Martin LVL3 strat:
1. 2 Back, Swallow, 4 Back
2. Swallow, 2 Back 3 Right
3. Swallow, 2 Right 3 Up
4. 1 Down 2 Left, Swallow. 3 Down towards wall.
5. Swallow

##### No LVL3
- If you will level up off a Swallow hit. T1 move up left, Swallow, move to wall. Face away from wall. Next turn finish with Swallow / back attack.
- If you won't level, move to wall so he can reach you from 2 side. Wind Force to your side that he can't reach, and face towards side with no Wind Tiles. He should attack you next to Wind Tile, and you attack him next turn from that Wind Tile. Accuracy is an issue.

Jewel or Paula are fine here, work exactly the same.

With current setup can use Fredrica w/ Owl, Seneca, and Andarc to kill cannons.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
- **Millay**: 6 Up 1 Left, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1 Left 3 Up, face right.
- **Ornela**: 6 Up 1 Right, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1U1R face up or right

- **Ameria**: Mount Owl, 9 Forward onto water tile. Switch to Corselia. Explosion Eye Fish. Try to kill only Eye Fish, killing only 5 units prevents extra cannon spawns.

##### Turn 2
- **Millay**: Rush Blue Fish in back from front. Get closer to cannons.
- **Ornela**: Move up, Rush someone (not mage, not enough EXP gained) further along the way if in the way. Should level up. Use extra move to move up.

- Fredrica: Rage
- Ornela: Flame
- Kyril: Rage

#### Info
- Ameria needs Godspeed. Role can be played by any character with 7 movement that can ride a Kangacorn and is slower than all enemies.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
- **Ornela**: 9 Forward, Flame Bead under middle Red Soldier.
- **Millay**: 10 Forward, **DISMOUNT**. Mother Earth Bead under bottom left Blue Soldier, **FACE RIGHT**.
- *Millay has to move to this tile to manipulate Owl enemies to move towards you.*
- **Fredrica**: 2 Left 6 Forward, Dismount. Strong Arm front Soldier.
- **Busk**: Move behind Ornela, switch to Lino. Unicorn lvl2 3 Red Soldiers.
- **Jewel/Paula**: Move adjacent to Ornela, switch to Simeon. Silent Lake middle Blue Soldier.
- **Paula/Paula**: Move behind Simeon, switch to Pablo. Co-op **Bottom Left** Soldier. **FACE BACK**.
- *Pablo face back manipulates Archer to target him, avoids crit chance on Millay. It's okay if he dies.*
- **Kyril**: 2 Left 4 Up. Rage Force Bead on bottom middle of circle (4 Up).
- **Ameria**: Mount Kangacorn. 10 Forward, in front of Simeon. Switch to Corselia, Explosion 4 Forward, hit everyone but Archer.

##### Turn 2
 **No important character should end up on a Fire Tile**.
- **Ornela**: Rush Archer from back, move in front of Millay.
- *If there was a survivor kill instead, as long as you can get to right tile.*
- **Millay**: 3 Right 7 Down. Rage Bead under furthest Archer/s.
- **Fredrica**: Mount **RED OWL**. 4 Left 4 Down.
- **Lino**: Move in front of Ornela, Rage Bead under Archers. *If you need to go further, mount Owl and switch to Seneca. She'll die to Blazing Wall. Don't want anyone too close to back group for AI reasons.*
- **Simeon**: Blazing Wall.
- **Pablo**: Move off fire tile.
- **Kyril**: Swallow Ogre Breath Chest (Left chest)
- **Corselia**: Start casting Blazing Wall

##### Turn 3
- **Ornela**: Kill a survivor if any.
- **Millay**: Kill an archer or Rage Force Bead.
- **Fredrica**: Rage Force Bead under 4 left enemies.

8 Kills to spawn first extra group. All bowmen, middle 2 water side 2 earth.
2 more kills spawn next 4. Middle column 2 water, sides 2 lightning. Front guy Swordsman, rest mages.

#### Notes
You can have Fredrica go 8 Forward T1 for the Strong Shot, this will let you skip the weapon sharpen. However, the red owl rider might move directly up instead ruining the Explosion.

]}/>

##### Beads
- Ornela: Mother Earth
- Kyril: Flowing

#### Strategy
General strategy is fast people rush bottom, Kyril hides in corner & Corselia kills enemies to protect Kyril.
Can kill up to 7 enemies. When you kill 8 enemies more spawn.

##### Turn 1
- **Ornela**: 8 Down.
- **Jewel**: Mount White Owl, 10 Down. Switch to Paula. *If already on Owl, dismount before switch. Used to slow her down.*
- **Ameria**: Switch to Corselia, move 5 Right or 1 Down 4 Right, Breath of Ice or Explosion. Make sure you kill Wind Mage on bottom part. Extra move back to furthest Water tile.
- **Kyril**: Flowing Force Bead 1 Down 3 Right. Move into bottom corner.

##### Turn 2
- **Ornela**: 2 Down 4 Right (out of range of cannon.)
- **Paula**: Mount **Armored** Kangacorn, Rush chest. Forward max. *Normal Kangacorn should work fine too*.
- **Kyril**: Try to kill someone, preferably with Cyclone Sword.
- **Corselia**: Kill something with Flaming Arrows
- Kyril and Corselia just kill stuff and hide from now on. Kyril can Swallow LVL3 people.
- Normal Kangacorn should be fine, I tested with 60SPD Jewel & 57SPD Ornela and it still worked out. Might be more based on Millay's speed.

##### Turn 3
- **Ornela**: Forward max twice.
- **Paula**: Switch to Millay. Mount White Owl. 1 Down 8 Right, Owl Heart. **Make sure you move first before Owl Heart!**

> Iskas should move 4 left with these positions, even if there's an Earth Tile there.

##### Turn 4
> Ornela needs to be before Iskas. Millay needs to be after Iskas. Iskas should Flaming Arrow Ornela unless Cannon shenaningans, then he casts Berserk Blow.

- **Ornela**: 5 Up, Mother Earth Bead 3 Right 1 Up so 1 tile under Iskas. Extra Move 3 Left. *(1 down 1 left from cannon.)*
- **Millay**: Move behind Iskas and attack to kill. Shouldn't even need to Dismount.

> If Millay misses, or if you run into issues because of the Rune Cannon, you can Extra Move Millay out of the way 
and have Ornela attack from behind too. If the cannon places Lightning Tiles under Iskas, probably better for Millay to switch to Pablo and place a Earth Tile under Iskas, and have Ornela attack him from behind on a Lightning tile.

#### Information
Iskas doesn't want to attack people that are on midair tiles.
Every point of SKL = 1% more accuracy vs Iskas (and probably in general).

### Fishskas
#### Setup
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Millay (K)', x: 2, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Fredrica', x: 2, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Ornela (RO)', x: 2, y: 3 },
]}/>

**REMOVE CORSELIA AND SIMEON FROM FORMATION**.
Order supposed to be Ornela > (Fishskas, Millay) > Fredrica > Eye

##### Strategy
- Ornela: 7 Right, Mother Earth Bead 4 Right under Fishskas
- Millay: 7 Right 2 Up. Switch to Simeon & Flowing Force 1 Down 1 Right
- Fredrica: 8 Right behind Red Fish, Switch to Corselia. Flaming Arrow Fishskas.

### Evil Eye
##### Information
- Evil Eye has 2 damage gates, at 33% & 66%. After each one it will back away and start charging. First unlocks it's column attack. After 2nd charge it does the big nuke.
- It does physical damage with its bunch of beams attack.

##### Strategy
 1. 1 Forward, Cyclone Force 4 Forward
 2. 3 Forward, Swallow LVL3. Extra move 1 more forward, to center Wind tile. Eye should move away now.
 3. Standby, face towards it. If under 500 damage, move 1 tile towards it, Swallow LVL1, and move back to center.
 4. Move behind it, Swallow LVL3 for kill.

After Mirror breaking cutscene **DONT MASH TRIANGLE**. Kyril gets stuck until you stop mashing.
Final Textbox is Corselia ""Kyril... Kyril!!"

## General Information
#### Counterattack
Can counter when hit
Probability reduced by enemy Bull's Eye.
25%/50% penalty to counter attack & avoidance when hit from side/back.
Can reduce penalty with Mind's Eye.

#### Mounts
Kangacorns: +3 MOV, JMP = 1
Normal kangacorn: +50% STR, +10% SPD... -30% EVA
Armored Kangacorn: +50% STR, +30% PDF... -30% EVA
Useable by 1h sword, spear and missile weapon users.

Owls: +2 MOV, JMP = 4 (dunno if that has any effect for the owls)
Red/Blue Giant Owl: +30% STR, +30% EVA, +30% SPD... -30% PDF
White Giant Owl (Armored): +30% STR, +30% EVA... -10% PDF
Useable by 1h sword, spear, and most archers (not Seneca). Archers have their range increased by 1 while on an owl.

#### Coops
kfcrispy: i don't know the coop damage formula, but they definitely don't use Battle Lust. perhaps they use raw stats (affected by terrain) and the base power like a spell

Can maybe test via editing stats.
+ATK (Seared Bonito) doesn't increase damage
Enemy Tile very slightly affects damage? (Went from 123 to 130 in test, going from positive to neutral)
Positive tile for allies slightly affects damage (Neutral tile Kyril 123, pos tile Kyril 133)

#### Items
Puffered Fish Sashimi doesn't raise M.ATK?

#### Firefly
If Enemies can't hit Eugene normally, but can hurt him by placing tiles they will place tiles.

#### Status
- **Unfriendly**: Also stops recharging of Co-ops.
- **Accuracy +**: Increases accuracy by 10%

#### Current Ideas
Post Obel can do sharpen / shop in Illuya instead of Nay.
Benefits:
- Has Rune Shop, early Gale potentially
- Potential tier 2 beads in bargains
- Crab Bun
Downsides:
- No Seared Bonito

#### Ranking
http://suikosource.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5022&sid=6a16db4f67d1fabdf82b6b494eeb3511&start=45#p155223
##### Criteria explanation
Turn amount: number of actions made regardless of foe or friend (!!!)
Total damage: The total damage all allies (excluding NPCs) received
Damage rate: The average damage dealt to enemies from attacks (including runes)
Positive element count: The number of times your allies (excluding NPCs) end a turn on positive element
Total value of received experience: self-explaining

##### Numeric values to determine the rank
STEP1 Determining the rank for each criteria
• Turn amount & total damage
S: base value +0%
A: base value +30%
B: base value +80%
C: above
• Damage rate & positive element count & total experience value
S: base value -0%
A: base value -30%
B: base value -80%
C: below
- Each stage has different base values (?) [Look at the sheet that KFCrispy shared some posts ago]
- [I don’t understand the first sentence] A missed attack is counted as an attack that did 0 damage
- [Not sure but it seems…] The base value for experience is 500 per enemy.
STEP2 For each of the 5 criteria you’ll get a score depending on the rank you achieved in each criteria
S: 0 A: 10 B: 30 C: 60
STEP3 These scores are used to calculate an average score that will finally determine the stage rank
S: less than 5 A: less than 13 B: less than 31 C: 31 or more
[-> it means you can A rank in 2 criteria as long as you S rank the remaining 3, because you would get 10+10+0+0+0=10 -> 20/5=4 -> S rank! If you B rank in any criteria there's no chance of getting stage rank S!]

#### Eugene days
Based off day in Obel.

Water Day: Move to Illuya, then Na-Nal
Wind Day: Na-Nal, Illuya, Na-Nal
Lightning: Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Fire: Illuya, Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Earth: Na-Nal

#### Legacy Graska 2
#### Setup
Backline formation doesn't matter except Kyril.
Middle front should be slower of Jewel / Paula.
Assuming Jewel is faster, adjust accordingly.
Speedwise ideally it's Ornela, Fredrica/Millay, Jewel, Paula.
Can adjust with mounts and/or Godspeed Anklets.
Want Paula to be 39SPD or more.
Ornela & Millay on Kangacorns.

##### Requirements
Fredrica: Rage/Fire Bead
Millay: Earth/Mother Earth Bead
Ornela: Cyclone Force Bead

Formation

Busk Kyril Simeon -
Millay Fredrica Paula Jewel Ornela

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Ornela: 7D (Even with back Red Soldiers)b, Cyclone Force Bead. Ideally on front guy in second group, but if Earth/Fire already set tile in front of Ornela works. Important part is to get Wind tile infront of front Blue Spearman.
Millay: 9D1R, Earth Force Bead middle spearman / Mother Earth Force tile below middle spearman.
Fredrica: Mount if not mounted, move next to front red swordsman and Fire Tile middle / Rage tile front.
Jewel: 8D1L, behind back red swordsman. Swap to Lino & Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Spearman.
Paula: 9D, swap to Seneca and Hawk LVL3. Should kill 6. Ideally front 8 are dead here.

Simeon: move up and Breath of Ice Ogre Breath (Left Chest)
Busk: move up
Kyril: move down

##### Turn 2
Simeon: Flowing Force Bead center column, 3 north of chest. Can move cursor to chest, move left to middle, then up 3.
Busk: move up (not into water).
Fredrica: move down, swap to Kika and kill something.
Rest: keep moving down and killing stuff. Be careful with Millay. Unit deaths don't matter but permadeath does.

##### Turn 3 & on.
Simeon move into front water tile.
When top soldiers spawn Breath of Ice middle 2. Busk gets on owl and kills right one.
Rest keep doing same thing.


### Haruna Previous
#### Setup
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Trishtan (K)', x: 1, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Kyril', x: 1, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Gretchen', x: 1, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Andarc', x: 1, y: 3 },
  { name: 'Eugene', x: 0, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Ameria', x: 0, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Jeremy', x: 0, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Pablo', x: 0, y: 3 },
]}/>

Note: Pablo is assumed to be slowest character here, doesn't have to be Pablo but you need someone slower than everyone else here.
Most slots are interchangable as well. Only important ones should be Kyril & Trishtan. The 4 Kangacorn riders are interchangable.

##### Beads
- Seneca: Wind x2
- Kika: Wind x2
- Flare: Flame, (Cyclone Sword)

- **Kika**: Move towards Archers, Falcon Thrust Archer that Millay can't rush for extra movement. Move back/left 1 tile with Extra Move.

##### Turn 4
- Top side changes depending on turn order. If Millay can reach the mage, go for the kill on the mage. If not, Kill 2 closest and Extra Move out of range. Kika its 5 back, Millay it's 1 up 1 left of Kika. Be mindful of archer getting double turn if killing mage. Also, Kika won't kill the Soldier without elemental advantage.
- Bottom half kills rest, chills.

##### Turn 5
- Top side finishes remaining 2 units.
