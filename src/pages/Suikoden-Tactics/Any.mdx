Edgar move 2D3R attack above unit face up
Brandeau move 4R2U face right

Brandeau move up 1 to end
Maybe worth attacking Pecke with Kyril / Andarc for EXP?
100 per hit, 155 for kill.

### The Night Sea #2
> If you finish kill all other Pirates before Kyril's 3rd turn (Fish Spawn), the battle ends.

 - **Edgar**: 1 Down 5 Right, Kill bottom Pirate (Spear). Face Right.
 - *Don't know how fight plays out if they miss a kill. Maybe retry?*
 - **Andarc**: 3 Right 2 Up, Thunder Runner Pirate in front of Rowdy Pirate (Lightning Elemental). He should be able to tank the hit, and it will give him +Tile while giving enemy pirates -Tile.
 - If Andarc was before enemy Pirates, place Lightning Tile 1 Right of Andarc to give Rowdy Pirate and himself +Tile.

##### Turn 2
 - **Brandeau**: Move behind Pirate that placed Water Tiles and kill him.
 - **Edgar**: Kill a Pirate.
 - **Andarc**: Kill last Pirate.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Andarc 2 Right, birds can go in front or behind him
Kyril kill bird not on bridge
Seneca + Andarc kill other bird
Won't Always go smoothly, improvise.
Want to talk to unlock Cohort & Dying Wish
Can use Thunder Runner & probably Cohort
Break through to second rock, break it.
Move Kyril to bottom right spot (in front of rock) **don't go into further half or enemies spawn.**
Move Andarc & Seneca as close as possible. Wait for Kyril's turn and standby.
Next person after Kyril moves up to a spot on the left where they can get hit from all directions and puts down a Lightning tile on themselves.
Other person does same.
Kyril moves straight up and standbys.
Goal is to bait units away from path so Kyril can cut through.


## The Evil Eye
### Underground Passage 2
#### Setup
Remove Medals from Kyril, attach as many as possible to Seneca, then Andarc.

#### Information
2 Left Bats Earth Water
3 Middle Skeletons w/ Sword 2 Wind 1 Lightning
Right Bat Wind, Right Skeleton w/ Bow Wind, Fire Elemental
Back Group: Skeleton Sword Fire, 2 Skeleton Bow Fire Lightning

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Andarc Flame Force Bead up as much as possible
Seneca run to bottom right corner
Kyril move up and kill stuff. T1 Attack right bird & face left to try to bait Skele onto right fire tile.
If Kyril is short damage can use Seneca to finish off bird T1, but don't risk it T2.

##### Turn 2
Use Seneca & Andarc to kill stuff when safe, focus on moving up.
Try to kill right Fire Skele with Thunder Runner.

Second group of units dont move until you move above the bridge.
Play slow and safe.

#### Other Info
Left Chest: Flame Force Bead x3
Top Chest: Salad x5
Getting either chest spawns a skeleton
One Skele drops Chain Mail.
You can use Extra Move to hit hit skele and move back out of trigger. Only hit skeleton will move.
Soloing with Kyril is actually viable here, don't know if faster though.
Medicine heals Skeletons :(

Want to equip the Chain Mail to Kyril at some point, even if just to sell for more money.

##### Turn 1
Move up main group.
Kika moves back, Nalleo either moves back or hits Wind Elemental.

]}/>

##### Beads
 - Trishtan: Fire, Water
 - Flare: Fire
 - One of Seneca, Andrac, Kyril: Fire

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Trishtan**: Forward max, place Fire Bead to the right of the archer.
 - **Flare**: move forward max and kill the archer.
 - **Kika**: move up max
 - **Seneca**: move up max
 - **Andrac**: move forward 5, next to Seneca.
 - **Kyril**: move forward max
 - *Wind Archer and soldier will move onto Fire tiles and attack Flare.*
 - **Maxine**: move forward max, kill Wind Soldier with Flaming Arrow.

##### Turn 2
 - **Trishtan**: move in front of Fire Soldier, place Water Bead under him
 - **Kika**: move behind archer and kill it
 - **Seneca**: 1 left forward max, kill Fire Soldier on Water Tile.
 - **Flare**: Move to front Water Tile, place Flame Bead 1 right of Wind Mage on left. Exact position doesn't matter.
 - **Andarc**: Move forward max, Thunder Runner Wind Mage to kill
 - **Kyril**: Forward max, Swallow Rune for damage if possible.
 - **Maxine**: Forward max if you can reach someone with Flaming Arrows, else Forward 4 to stay on Fire tile.

##### Turn 3
 - If units are too far away, just wait for them to come to you. If they moved forward on right side it's fine to attack now. You don't want to attack them near middle because it will pull other enemies towards the right.
 - Have Flare or Maxine break the chest on the right to get the Wing Mail. It doesn't need to be rushed, you'll have time as you chase the last mage.
 - Setup for Dying Wish, you want Kyril 1 tile below 1 tile right of the box. Have someone place a Fire tile below Kyril to kill Busk.

##### Beads
 - Trishtan: Fire
 - Seneca: Lightning
 - Flare: Water (optional)

##### Skills
 - Kika: Jump, Extra Move

#### Strategy

> Final Version: Use Cohort T3 to take out Roget & 2 Fish that Spawn from your side above them.
> Seneca & Andarc have exactly enough movement to reach the required spot, so make sure they're path is always cleard.
> Because Trishtan needs to start further back, he needs Godspeed.
> Extra Move on Seneca. Andarc, and Kika helps a ton here.
> T1/2 Flare takes out Blue Fish,

##### Turn 1
 - Trishtan: 6 Down 1 Left, Rush Orange Fish **(NOT RED FISH)**
 - Kika: 5 Down, Attack / Falcon Slash Red Fish. Extra move 1 Left or 1 Down.
 - Flare: 1 Left 4 Up
 - Seneca: 2 Left 3 Down, Lightning Force Bead tile to her right.
 - Andarc: 3 Left 2 Down, Try to place Lightning Tiles under fish, can Thunder Runner if it would kill something.
 - Kyril: 1 Right Max Up, Attack Bowman if you can.

##### Turn 2
 - Flare: Move out of range of Red Fish
Trishtan kill one of center ones, leave top one for Kika
Kyril move towards Kika & Trishtan and Cyclone Sword any water panels.
Other 3 take out the ones on hill.

Use Akaghi & Kyril to put Flame Tiles under Roget.

> (Worse than Cohort strat, but depending on Cohort cooldown might be necessary?) With Jump & Extra Move (almost certainly need jump, possibly don't need Extra Move) Kika can reach Roget Turn 3. If you put a Fire Tile below him T3 with Trishtan and Falcon Thrust with Kika from a Wind Tile you one shot him. Probably best strat for the fight, need to work out details. In attempt he tried to Wind of Sleep Kika, need to figure out way to deal with that if he hits sleep.

#### Information

Trishtan mounted, make sure Mizuki has Water Bead and Medicine (starting items)
Trishtan should have a Wind Force Bead.
Also consider using Wendel instead of Mizuki, she's a little faster. Might be too fast though?


#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Trishtan**: move forward, unmount
 - **Millay** **Mount**, move all the way up, **Switch to Kika**. Seared Bonito self.
 - **Mizuki**: move forward, Medicine (to slow her down, want her after Martin)
 - **Kyril**: move 1 up, all the way forward

##### Turn 2
 - **Trishtan**: Mount, move forward right above rock. Front should be facing Martin, rock left, empty right and back. Wind Force Bead tile in front of self.
 - **Mizuki**: If Martin moved already move up and put Water bead under him. If not, switch to Seneca and put Wind Panels on tiles we'd be attacking Martin from.
 - **Kika**: Falcon Slash Martin, preferably from back. Use extra move to move out of his way so Kyril can Swallow Rune.
 - **Kyril**: Move up and attack / Swallow.

If not dead and Trishtan outspeeds can switch to Andarc and Thunder Runner.

> If you used Cohort on Roget in El-Eal, it takes about 2 turns too much to get it back here before you need it.
> Seems to be about a 4/5T Recharge, not including El-Eal. So 6-7?
> Flare can't talk to Corselia yet.

##### Turn 1
Kika Move left up, Wind Force Bead tile in front of her.
Millay move up to Wind Tile 1U1L from Kika, Rush if Fish there.
Corselia move 2U1L, Breath of Ice
Andarc Standby
Seneca move into position for Dying Wish (3L), attack/Medicine (just to slow her down)
Kyril move up 1, Dying Wish. Extra move towards Kika/Millay.
Corselia finish 3 fish with Breath of Ice

##### Turn 2
Kika & Millay hold choke and kill fish.
Kyril move towards them.

Andarc & Seneca kill last fish with Thunder Runner + Attack and move up. Getting set up for Cohort.
**Corselia Standby**. Need to do this to get next Breath of Ice on time.

##### Turn 3
Cohort Attack + Breath of Ice bottom front 3 fish. Finish last one with Berserk Blow + Seneca Attack.
Once you clear out enough fish with other group start moving forward. Don't move too far though, or you risk getting Breath of Iced by far back fish.

3 Fish spawn in that are Lightning Element
If possible change tiles, as long as you have no element disadvantage Rush or Falcon LVL2 should 1 shot.

#### Information
Positive Terrain requirement is 25, can get with 20? Had 23, still got S
Gotta kill elementals
2 new groups spawn, one in bottom column 1 in middle
1 co-op for each bottom group is good strat.
Chest is Ninja Braces

#### Reward

### Caleron Laboratory #2
#### Setup
**Equip Rusty Cog to Millay**
Replace Andarc with Trishtan
Dismount Millay, Mount Trishtan
Formation

Seneca Millay Kika
Kyril Corselia Trishtan

#### Strategy
Careful with Wind Tile usage at start, 2nd group of 3 fish is Wind Element
Also be careful of approach with Millay, she can get murdered by remaining fish + soldiers T2 if positioned badly / not full HP.
Roget will cast Wind of Sleep

##### Turn 1
Kika move forward max, Falcon Thrust Fish for kill
Trishtan move infront of bottom fish, dismount, attack.
Millay mount, move to back fish and Rush to kill one (one Trishtan attacked)
Seneca move forward 4, Standby
Kyril move up & Swallow Sword or attack fish.
Corselia move forward (make sure not in range of bottom fish if it's alive and hasn't moved yet) and Breath of Ice a top group.

After this just keep moving up and killing fish. Play carefully, people can definitely die here.
Eventually want to try to rush Roget with Extra Move Millay.

### Terana Plain
#### Setup
Formation
Trishtan (Mount) Seneca Kika Millay
Ameria Andrac Kyril Corselia

#### Information
Trishtan isn't necessary.
Trishtan into Gary swap into Ameria swap seems good, also uses 1 less character.

##### Turn 1
We take out the left group of Earth guys first.
Trishtan move up left, behind top guy and rush.
Kika moves in front of middle guy and Falcon Slash
Seneca moves 3L 1U and Cyclone Swords Kika's Tile
Millay moves in front of left guy and attacks
Corselia moves up and charges Breath of Ice
Andrac moves up and Thunder Runners back Fire guy or charges Berserk Blow
Kyril moves up and attacks Fire guy
Ameria moves towards Wind Elemental, away from enemies. Her only job in the fight is killing the elemental.

##### Turn 2 and on
Slowly kill off Bandits while putting down wind tiles.
Try to setup Cohort for the main group.
Be careful with rushing too far forward, these guys hurt. Also be mindful of Yellow Mercenary and his ability to hit a charging mage.
The Mercs won't move up until you move & stay 1 tile below rock or you've killed all other bandits.
Once you kill a Mercenary 4 more bandits spawn.
Mercenary Leader hurts like hell, want to get rid of her ASAP.

## Hope in Haruma
### Caravan
### Haruna
#### Setup
Formation
Andarc Kika Millay Corselia
Trishtan Kyril Seneca

#### Strategy
We REALLY want to S Rank this.

Practice attempt with this setup went insanely well
Kika, Millay (Mount), Kyril, Seneca
Trishtan, Corselia, Andarc

Millay straight ahead and rushed guy lined up with wooden board. Then moved back, lined up with both boards.
Kika moved up and Falcon Thrusted closest guy from side for kill
Trishtan moved up a few tiles, switched to Gary, and buffed Kika and Millay
Corselia moved up as far as possible and Breath of Ice'd around the left wooden board
Rest of the fight Kika & Millay demolished left roof, rest of team handled rest.
Only problem was lower area officer, perhaps bring Flame Force Bead for him and nuke with magic.

##### Turn 1
Trishtan move to start of wooden board between roofs, **Dismount**, Wind Force Tile 2 tiles to his left and face left.
Kika move up to first soldier and Falcon Thrust. Face up.
Millay move between 2 back soldiers and Rush right one. Face left.

Rest move up.
Andarc Berserk Blow wooden board soldier if you can do so safely, if not Berserk Blow rooftop soldier / nothing (for Extra Move). Continue to move up on right side of roof, outside of left archer range.
Corselia can try to Breath of Ice soldier on roof (as long as she'll level from the exp.) Still want to cast Breath of Ice for Extra move even if cancelled.
Seneca & Kyril move up and attack remaining soldier if possible. If not, Standby and do it next turn.

##### Turn 2 and on
Get Trishtan out of choke if there's someone in front of him so Kika or Millay can break through. Make sure you kill the soldier on the roof here.
Corselia move towards Simeon and Breath of Ice the 3 soldiers, hitting Simeon too if necessary. Killing them should spawn next group.

Keep moving up safely, want to setup for Dying Wish on Turn 3.

Formation you should be aiming for is
-      Kyril   -
Seneca Chimney Andarc

The Officer moves up once you pass the chimney I'm pretty sure. Also want to hit him with a bit of damage as he won't die to just Dying Wish. Also want to put a wind tile under Seneca & Kyril, as they can get hit (Seneca by archers on roof.)

Millay & Kika slowly make way up roof on left side. Make sure you place Wind Tiles and play safe. Officer is tanky and hits hard, and need to watch for staff user Berserk Blow.

Depart to Small Border Village

### Small Border Village (Fight)
#### Strategy (Old)
Kill 2 of 3 of first group, sleep cycle the last guy with Simeon.
Earth bead thunder cannon, kill with Simeon Breath of Ice
Dismount Jewel & Paula, have Millay ride owl through left side, switch to Kangacorn and kill cannons with Rush.
Might want to bring an additional unit as bait.
Might want to remove Wingmail, not good if attacked by back Fire people.

#### Strategy (New)
 * Minimal Units
 * Andarc & Fredrica to clear 2 closest Rune Cannons. Can maybe switch to Fredrica and use someone else? Get Fredrica as close to next Rune Cannon as possible to minimize flight.
 * Mind Andarc's positioning, to avoid Rune Cannon animations.
 * Millay murders through right side, leaves 1 alive and run to top-right corner. Dismount when in corner, wait for owl, and fly to next 2 Rune Cannons. When you get close to first one place Cyclone bead below it so it takes damage and you gain buff.
 * Fredrica takes Owl, flies down left side, switches to Kika and LVL3s the Cannon.

Alternate Approach: Don't bother with left side Owls at all, just go down right side. If so, maybe only use 1 mage to minimize animation time. Jewel and Paula can probably take out last cannon. Maybe even no mages.
Confirmed Works.

Downside of not using Andarc: Doesn't get 2nd Rune Slot fast enough to equip Fire without removing Lightning.

Chest 2 is Mother Earth Orb

</Menu>

### Mido Plains
#### Setup
Bottom right corner mounts Kangacorn.

Formation:
Millay
Trishtan Kika
Kyril Frederica
Corselia Jewel Paula (Kangacorn)

Formation doesn't matter much, just want Fredrica, Paula & Jewel on right side & Paula or Jewel on right 3 tiles.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Frederica & Paula/Jewel: Set up Cohort. Mount owl if needed, move to correct tile. Switch to Seneca / Andrac (whichever has Flame Force Bead), and Flame Force Bead tile between 4 soldiers. Second one moves into 2nd Cohort position, switches to other one and Cohorts. This will kill 1-4 soldier.
Paula/Jewel: Mount Kangacorn, move to tile to the right of the right Fire Tile, switch to Simeon and Silent Lake 4 tiles ahead. Should hit all 3 mages.
Rest move up, try to set up Wind Tiles / finish remaining soldiers if some survived.
Alternatively, use Seneca first and Hawk Rune instead of fire tile. Gets more EXP, doesn't require Flame Bead and guarantees kill on last 3. Will never kill front one.
Can hopefully finish off remaining soldier with Millay or Kika before he moves.
Remaining move up and start placing down Wind Tiles.

Also, take note of speed order between Jewel, Fredrica, and Paula.

##### Turn 2 and on.
Simeon move up at least 1 tile and try to kill mages on right with Breath of Ice. Watch out for second group, they move fast and might get 2 turns before some of your characters get their second turn.
You want to move up 1 tile so you can Silent Lake the back mage next turn, so he can't Silent Lake you.

Strategy is just move up, place tiles and slowly kill stuff. Be careful, units here do hurt, especially the Kangacorn. You lose if Kyril or Corselia die and Millay perma-dying is really bad too.

Both spawns are based off unit kills.

### Mido Plains (Martin Duel)
If he does Rage Sword LVL3 run to bottom right corner, Cyclone Sword T2. When he reaches you just move behind him and attack from back.
If he doesn't just move behind him and attack and move away. He should put down fire tiles, you move left and put Wind Tiles, he moves up and attacks, you attack him from back.

## The Imperial City of Graska
### World Map
Move to Graska.

#### Strategy
Send Jewel & Paula on Owls over wall, switch slower (Jewel) to Millay. She clears mages by wall if needed
Goal is put down 3 Rage Force Beads before killing Roget. 1 is in middle of barricades (2 below middle fish).
The other 2 are 2 above side fish. Get Simeon and Corselia setup on Water tiles for buff, when ready have Millay kill Roget to spawn soldiers and Blazing Wall.

#### Information
Even if you kill the 3 fish and Roget at the same time, the rest will still spawn.

### Blood Stained Palace
#### Setup
For Jewel/Paula, slower person gets Red Owl. Faster person after mount goes center middle. Assuming Jewel is faster here.
Millay and Ornela on Kangacorns

 * Red Owl is +30% SPD
 * Kangacorn is 10% SPD

Formation
Millay Kyril Ornela
Paula  Jewel Busk

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 * Ornela: 7U1R, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1U1R face up or right
 * Jewel: 9U (behind Red Swordsman), switch to Simeon. Silent Lake - Top left corner should be on top left staff wielder. Should hit fish and all staff wielders, and put Simeon on water. Face up.
 * Paula: 8U, switch Kika, Falcon Thrust Red Swordsman. Face up.
 * Millay: 6U1L, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1L3U face right.
 * Busk: Standby to speed up next turn. Want to go after Big Fish before Kika.
 * Kyril: Move up and kill Yellow Bowman guy. If he hasn't moved yet can just move up for potential fish backup kill or standby to kill Yellow Bowman.

##### Turn 2
 * Ornela: Move up, Sword of Thunder Bowman in the back if he's along the way. Use extra move to move up.
   - Sword of Thunder is to guarantee survival, can get Breath of Ice'd + bad tile'd. Even without rush you get close enough.
 * Millay: Move up, Rush someone if in the way. Can move towards front left to avoid fish magic attack.
 * Busk: Mount Armored Owl, move up and Lightning Force Bead the fish
 * Kika: Kill Fish with Falcon LVL3
 * Kyril: Kill a unit / nothing. Backup for fish kill if Kika dies.

##### Turn 3
 * Ornela / Millay: move up, swap to Seneca / Fredrica and kill eyes.
   - Rune Cannons are fairly resistant to magic, hence Seneca / Fredrica.

#### Information
Chest is Chaos Shield
S: Imperial Ring

## A Parting of Ways
### Caravan
Enter Graska

### Graska 2
#### Setup
Backline formation doesn't matter except Kyril.
Middle front should be slower of Jewel / Paula.
Assuming Jewel is faster, adjust accordingly.
Speedwise ideally it's Ornela, Fredrica/Millay, Jewel, Paula.
Can adjust with mounts and/or Godspeed Anklets.
Want Paula to be 39SPD or more.
Ornela & Millay on Kangacorns.

Requirements
Fredrica: Rage/Fire Bead
Millay: Earth/Mother Earth Bead
Ornela: Cyclone Force Bead

Formation
- Busk Kyril Simeon -
Millay Fredrica Paula Jewel Ornela

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Ornela: 7D (Even with back Red Soldiers)b, Cyclone Force Bead. Ideally on front guy in second group, but if Earth/Fire already set tile in front of Ornela works. Important part is to get Wind tile infront of front Blue Spearman.
Millay: 9D1R, Earth Force Bead middle spearman / Mother Earth Force tile below middle spearman.
Fredrica: Mount if not mounted, move next to front red swordsman and Fire Tile middle / Rage tile front.
Jewel: 8D1L, behind back red swordsman. Swap to Lino & Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Spearman.
Paula: 9D, swap to Seneca and Hawk LVL3. Should kill 6. Ideally front 8 are dead here.

Simeon: move up and Breath of Ice Ogre Breath (Left Chest)
Busk: move up
Kyril: move down

##### Turn 2
Simeon: Flowing Force Bead center column, 3 north of chest. Can move cursor to chest, move left to middle, then up 3.
Busk: move up (not into water).
Fredrica: move down, swap to Kika and kill something.
Rest: keep moving down and killing stuff. Be careful with Millay. Unit deaths don't matter but permadeath does.

##### Turn 3 & on.
Simeon move into front water tile.
When top soldiers spawn Breath of Ice middle 2. Busk gets on owl and kills right one.
Rest keep doing same thing.

#### Information.
S: Gate of Graska
Left Chest: Ogre Breath
Right Chest: Guardian Vestment
8 Kills to spawn first extra group. All bowmen, middle 2 water side 2 earth.
2 more kills spawn next 4. Middle column 2 water, sides 2 lightning. Front guy Swordsman, rest mages.

Depart > Secret Facility

### Iskas
#### Strategy New
##### Equipment
Remove Mother Earth Armor and Ogre Breath from Ornela, make sure she has 1 Mother Earth Force Bead
Give Kika Mother Earth Armor & Ogre Breath

##### Speed
Want fastest of Paula/Jewel/Fredrica, but slower than Ornela & Millay.

##### Formation
|   |        |              |        |
|---|--------|--------------|--------|
| - | Millay | Speed Person | Ornela |
| - |    -   |      -       |   -    |
|   |    -   |      -       |        |

##### Strategy (New)
Move Ornela 8U1R, Mother Earth Bead under Iskas so there's 1 tile in front him that's Earth too
Millay move up to side of fish, Rush.
Paula Mount Kangacorn, move up 10, switch to Kika and Falcon Storm Thrust for kill.

#### Strategy (Old)
Want Mother Earth Armor and beads on Millay and Ornela
Start them on 2 top right tiles with Owls. Go right, and book it towards Iskas. You can use Rush on the chest for a little boost.
Switch to Kangacorns for 1 extra MOV

When you get in range, 1st one Mother Earth Beads Iskas
Second one gets best angle possible and attacks.
If you can't attack before element change / movement, reapply Mother Earth

Other end of the fight just want to stall. Can kill a lot of them, but if you kill too many more will spawn.
Silent Lake with Simeon T1 is really good, he'll probably die for it but it's worth. Wind of Sleep is also really useful here.

Can try 3 Person party, with Kyril, Millay, and Ornela. Kyril hides in corner, Ornela and Millay rush right side.
If so, probably need better defensive equipment for Kyril, perhaps consumable +DEF item. Ornela gets beat up too, consider same for her. Millay can maybe use +ATK consumable item. Also, Rush doesn't work on Iskas.

#### Information
Bottom Right Chest Guardian Vestment
Left Chest Hero's Armor
More units spawn after killing a certain amount
Iskas is Lightning Element
Units keep Spawning 1 by one even after second phase
Rune Cannons inflict random statuses

### Fishskas
Setup is Millay and Ornela on Owls on right side, Fredrica & Jewel (or any 2 somewhat fast people that can use owls) in Center Middle.
You want Millay or Ornela (whoever is putting Earth tile) to be faster than Fishskas. Other one has to be faster than remaining 2.
Jewel & Fredrica need to both be faster or slower than Fishskas. Can't have 1 of each. Should always be slower.

Give Rage Robes to Andarc and Simeon. Make sure that they aren't in the party. You can kick out everyone else (doesn't matter).

Ornela or Millay move up, **dismount**, Mother Earth Bead under Fishskas. Make sure you aren't lined up with him vertically.
Ornela or Millay move up, **dismount**, Rage Bead so there's a fire tile behind a fish and a fire tile in front of a fish. Make sure you aren't lined up with Fishskas him vertically.

Jewel/Fredrica mount owl. Move to Fire Tile behind fish, switch to Simeon and Flaming Arrow Fishskas. If Simeon is strong this will kill. If not next step. Make sure you do this before Andarc's part, since he will switch field to Lightning.
Jewel/Fredrica mount owl, move to Fire tile in front of fish. Switch to Andarc, Thunder Runner for the kill.

### Evil Eye
Basically Cyclone Sword, wait for it to get closer, then LVL3 Swallow from behind.
Might take a few hits.

Final Textbox is Corsela ""Kyril... Kyril!!"



## General Information
#### Counterattack
Can counter when hit
Probability reduced by enemy Bull's Eye.
25%/50% penalty to counter attack & avoidance when hit from side/back.
Can reduce penalty with Mind's Eye.

#### Mounts
Kangacorns: +3 MOV, JMP = 1
Normal kangacorn: +50% STR, +10% SPD... -30% EVA
Armored Kangacorn: +50% STR, +30% PDF... -30% EVA
Useable by 1h sword, spear and missile weapon users.

Owls: +2 MOV, JMP = 4 (dunno if that has any effect for the owls)
Red/Blue Giant Owl: +30% STR, +30% EVA, +30% SPD... -30% PDF
White Giant Owl (Armored): +30% STR, +30% EVA... -10% PDF
Useable by 1h sword, spear, and most archers (not Seneca). Archers have their range increased by 1 while on an owl.

#### Coops
kfcrispy: i don't know the coop damage formula, but they definitely don't use Battle Lust. perhaps they use raw stats (affected by terrain) and the base power like a spell

Can maybe test via editing stats.
+ATK (Seared Bonito) doesn't increase damage
Enemy Tile very slightly affects damage? (Went from 123 to 130 in test, going from positive to neutral)
Positive tile for allies slightly affects damage (Neutral tile Kyril 123, pos tile Kyril 133)

#### Items
Puffered Fish Sashimi doesn't raise M.ATK?

#### Firefly
If Enemies can't hit Eugene normally, but can hurt him by placing tiles they will place tiles.

#### Current Ideas
Skip Eugene, get Maxine & Pablo
Maybe spec Flare a bit, Maxine and Flare will be used for El-Eal > Calleron Laboratory.
Considering specing out Akaghi a little bit too for both El-Eal battles and Callonbal 1.
Keep Thunder God Garb on Seneca, at least until after Caleron Lab. She's mostly with Andarc up to that point.

Post Obel can do sharpen / shop in Illuya instead of Nay.
Benefits:
 * Has Rune Shop, early Gale potentially
 * Potential tier 2 beads in bargains
 * Crab Bun
Downsides:
 * No Seared Bonito

##### Criteria explanation
Turn amount: number of actions made regardless of foe or friend (!!!)
Total damage: The total damage all allies (excluding NPCs) received
Damage rate: The average damage dealt to enemies from attacks (including runes)
Positive element count: The number of times your allies (excluding NPCs) end a turn on positive element
Total value of received experience: self-explaining

##### Numeric values to determine the rank
STEP1 Determining the rank for each criteria
• Turn amount & total damage
S: base value +0%
A: base value +30%
B: base value +80%
C: above
• Damage rate & positive element count & total experience value
S: base value -0%
A: base value -30%
B: base value -80%
C: below
- Each stage has different base values (?) [Look at the sheet that KFCrispy shared some posts ago]
- [I don’t understand the first sentence] A missed attack is counted as an attack that did 0 damage
- [Not sure but it seems…] The base value for experience is 500 per enemy.
STEP2 For each of the 5 criteria you’ll get a score depending on the rank you achieved in each criteria
S: 0 A: 10 B: 30 C: 60
STEP3 These scores are used to calculate an average score that will finally determine the stage rank
S: less than 5 A: less than 13 B: less than 31 C: 31 or more
[-> it means you can A rank in 2 criteria as long as you S rank the remaining 3, because you would get 10+10+0+0+0=10 -> 20/5=4 -> S rank! If you B rank in any criteria there's no chance of getting stage rank S!]
