##### Beads
 - Seneca & Walter: Flame
 - Kyril: Lightning

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1

### The Night Sea #1
##### Turn 1

 - **Brandeau / Edgar**: Move below front Pirate, attack & hopefully kill.
 - **Brandeau / Edgar**: Move to closest tile to cannon possible.
 - *If 1st failed to kill, move 2 Left 1 Up of 1st person, face forward.*


##### Turn 2
 - Step on tile to win.

### The Night Sea #2
> If you finish kill all other Pirates before Kyril's 3rd turn (Fish Spawn), the battle ends.
> Want Andarc LVL2 preferably, so he is slower than Pirates. That way he can Thunder Runner a Pirate.
> Probably want Kyril level 1, just so you have more time.

#### Setup
##### Beads
 - Andarc: Lightning

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Brandeau**: 1 Down 5 Right, Kill bottom Pirate (Spear). Face Right.
 - **Edgar**: 1 Down 5 Right, Kill bottom Pirate (Spear). Face Right.
 - *Don't know how fight plays out if they miss a kill. Maybe retry?*
 - **Andarc**: 3 Right 2 Up, Thunder Runner Pirate in front of Rowdy Pirate (Lightning Elemental). He should be able to tank the hit, and it will give him +Tile while giving enemy pirates -Tile.
 - This turn can change a lot based off speed, prioritize making sure your pirates survive. Lightning Force Bead is for either Jolly or Rowdy pirate if they move up early, for Jolly to weaken his attackers. If none of pirates have moved yet, place Lightning Bead 1 Right of Andarc to give Rowdy Pirate and himself +Tile.

##### Turn 2
 - **Brandeau**: Move behind Pirate that placed Water Tiles and kill him.
 - **Edgar**: Kill a Pirate.
 - **Andarc**: Kill last Pirate.

#### Rewards
S: Steele's Shield (can be useful for 1 fight tops)
Pirates Survive: Strength Sash (nice but really hard to get)
Prime Gold Ore if you kill Steele.

 - **Flare**: Forward Max and kill the archer.
 - **Kika**: Forward Max
 - **Seneca**: Forward Max.

 - If units are too far away, just wait for them to come to you. If they moved forward on right side it's fine to attack now. You don't want to attack them near middle because it will pull other enemies towards the right.
 - Have Flare or Maxine break the chest on the right to get the Wing Mail. It doesn't need to be rushed, you'll have time as you chase the last mage.
 - Setup for Dying Wish, you want Kyril 1 tile below 1 tile right of the box. Have someone place a Fire tile below Kyril to kill Busk.

 1. Switch: Mizuki > Kika
 2. Swap: Kika & Corselia
 3. Switch: Trishtan > Millay

> Should consider Trishtan Kangacorn start instead of Kika & switch T1. Would speed up setup for next fight too.

##### Beads
 - Seneca: Wind

> If you used Cohort on Roget in El-Eal, it takes about 2 turns too much to get it back here before you need it.
> Seems to be about a 4/5T Recharge, not including El-Eal. So 6-7?
> Flare can't talk to Corselia yet.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Trishtan**: 4 Up 2 Forward, Switch to Kika. Or just dismount and switch next turn.
 - **Millay**: Mount, 5 Up 3 Forward, up to Wind Tile 1 Up 1 Forward from Kika. Rush Fish if it's there.
 - **Corselia**: 4 Forward, Breath of Ice 3 Fish.
 - **Seneca**: 3 Up, Medicine / place Wind bead or something to slow her down. Don't attack any of 3 front fish, Corselia needs to get the kill. If she's after Andarc can just standby after movement.
 - **Andarc**: Standby
 - **Kyril** Forward 1, Dying Wish. Extra move towards Kika/Millay.
 - **Corselia**: Finish 3 fish with Breath of Ice

##### Turn 2
 - **Andarc**: 2 Up 1 Forward onto Lightning tile, Thunder Runner last fish. Extra move 2 Forward.
 - **Seneca**: 3 Forward 1 Down, finish blue fish. Extra move 1 forward.
 - **Corselia**: 3 Forward 1 Up, onto bottom-right Water tile.
 - Top side: Slowly move forward with Wind tiles and kill everything. Hold choke so fish don't get past you.
 - Don't move past 3 Forward of furthest Wind Tile Kika placed T1. Or, alternatively, the hole above, that's 1 past the bridge at the top. This triggers the other fish to move forward. Only do this when ready.

##### Turn 3 & on
 - **Bottom side**: Cohort Attack + Breath of Ice bottom front 3 fish. Finish last one with Lightning Magic + Seneca Attack. Start making sure to step on good tiles for S-rank.
 - **Top side**: Once you clear out enough fish with other group start moving forward. Don't move too far though, or you risk getting Breath of Iced by far back fish.

If possible change tiles, as long as you have no element disadvantage Rush or Falcon LVL2 should 1 shot.

#### Information
Positive Terrain requirement is 25, can get with 17.

 - **Millay**: Mount Kangacorn, 8 Forward. Rush **BOTTOM** Fish. 2 Left, Face down.

 6. Swap: Seneca & Corselia

##### Beads
 - **Trishtan**: Wind

#### Information
 - Back 5 don't move unless you cross line or kill all other bandits or damage them
 - Try to keep units centered, or back 5 bandits will kinda go all over the place
 - Can place Wind Tile where Yellow Mercenary will attack from, he will move onto it if he can hit someone.

#### Strategy
Overview is to kill all but 1 Bandit ASAP without crossing trigger line for Mercenaries. Position for Cohort & Breath of Ice, and kill remaining Bandit. Improvise on killing rest.

##### Turn 1
 - **Trishtan**: **DISMOUNT**, Left 4, Wind Force Bead between 2 back Bandits.
 - **Kika**: 2 Left 4 Up, Attack/Falcon backmost Bandit.
 - **Millay**: 6 Left 4 Up, Rush closest Bandit.
 - **Seneca**: 1 Left 4 Up, Strong Arm middle Bandit.

> Note Seneca's current position. 1 Left of this is middle of grid of safe spots from when Mercs move up. Before you kill last Bandit, you want to make sure that no one is past Seneca. They can be 1 tile more forward for every tile to the side.

 - **Corselia**: 1 Up 2 Left, Water Force in front of her so 2 Fire Bandits are on Water Tiles.
 - **Andarc**: 4 Up 1 Left, Berserk Blow 1 of 2 Fire Bandits. Go for right if Kika countered left. Standby after Berserk Blow.
 - **Kyril**: If you can kill left bandit kill him from behind, if not kill right from behind.

##### Turn 2
> Make sure you kill last Bandit before or after whole group of Mercs has gone. Don't want to split up their turns.

 - **Trishtan**: Chase and kill Wind Elemental rest of fight.
 - **Kika**: Move up and Falcon Storm Thrust close Water Bandit, then move back to Wind Tile.
 - **Millay**: Rush a Bandit, back to your area.
 - **Seneca**: Kill Bandit if possible, if not place useful tile. Want her position to be 1 left of current.
 - **Corselia**: Water Force Fire Bandit if needed, move back towards middle. If possible set up Water Tile for self for Breath of Ice. Want her position for Breath of Ice to be 1 behind Seneca's future position.
 - **Kyril/Andarc**: Try to kill a Bandit.
 - Should generally be one Bandit left alive.

##### Turn 3
 - Start setting up for the Mercenary kill. Kill remaining Bandits if turn order allows.
 - Move people into proper positions, have Corselia start casting Breath of Ice if the time it will go off makes sense, if not place Water Tile where Corselia will be.
 - Position Seneca & Andarc for Cohort.
 - Rest place tiles, make sure to be in safe spots that won't mess with AI's movement.

##### Turn 4
 - **Millay**: Rush & Kill Mercenary Leader, back up again with Extra Move.
 - **Corselia**: Breath of Ice Mercs.
 - **Andarc & Seneca**: Cohort Mercs.
 - Rest: Kill stuff if possible, place tiles, etc.

##### Turn 5
 - **Millay**: Rush & Kill Bandit Leader.
 - Improvise rest of fight.

 - *If no Berserk Blow, Thunder Runner and use SoC lvl3 to get Wind tile under Kika. Finish with Seneca T2.*

#### Strategy
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Kyril', x: 3, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Andarc', x: 4, y: 3 },
]}/>

 1. Swap: Kyril & Andarc
 2. Remove: Everyone else

Andarc's only job is to be slower than 3 Lightning guys, can be done by anyone. Too slow is probably bad though. They have around 27 speed. If Andarc is too fast use someone else. Corselia good candidate.

##### Beads
 - Kyril: Thunder, Mother Earth
 - Millay: Cyclone, Wind or Healing Item

#### Strategy (New)
##### Turn 1
 - **Andarc**: Switch to Millay, Mount, 4 Right 2 Up, Rush Soldier by Wall. Extra Move 4 Up face down.
 - **Kyril**: 1 Up 1 Left, Thunder Force Bead 4 Up, Extra Move 2 Down 1 Right.

##### Turn 2
 - **Kyril**: Standby
 - **Millay**: 1 Up 1 Right, Rush Soldier from top. 5 Right 1 Up.

##### Turn 3
 - **Kyril**: 5 Left, Mother Earth Bead 4 Up.
 - **Millay**: 9 Up (top right corner), **DISMOUNT**. If after Kyril T3 and healthy can Standby, else Heal / Bead self.

##### Turn 4
Take note of who's faster between Paula and Jewel. Red Owl is counted towards Paula's so she can be slower but still go first.

 - **Paula**: Fly behind left cannon, **DISMOUNT**, attack and hopefully kill (range).
 - **Jewel**: Fly to left cannon, kill it.
 - **Kyril**: Kill left cannon with Swallow LVL1 if it survived, else just sit in corner.
 - **Selma**: Sit in corner rest of fight.
 - **Millay**: Mount Red Owl, 9 Up, Cyclone Force Bead 1 Up 1 Left (bottom right corner of cannon)

##### Turn 5
Everyone but Millay does nothing from now on.

 - **Millay**: Dismount, 3 Up 1 Left (onto Wind Tile), Attack and kill Cannon. Extra Move 1 Right 2 Up, behind Chest. (This seems to prevent Cannon attack)

##### Turn 6
 - **Millay**: **Mount**, 1 Up 6 Left, Rush Cannon from top-left.

##### Turn 7
 - **Millay**: Rush final Cannon for Victory.

#### Information
S-Rank requires 28 +Tiles, not viable at all with this strat.

]}/>

#### Beads
 - Fast #2: Rage Force Bead
 - Seneca: Cyclone Force Bead x3, maybe Earth Bead

#### Strategy
I think for this strat to work as listed the Earth Archer needs to be fast.
Also, apparently Fredrica isn't guaranteed to have a LVL3 skill point............
Had an attempt with 30 SKL, she needs 37.

##### Turn 1
 - **Fast#1**: Move to right of right soldier, switch to Simeon, Silent Lake 4 Up (get 3 mages on right).
 - **Fast#2**: Move to 2 in front of front soldier (behind where Fredrica will be), Rage Force Bead under front Soldier.
 - **Fredrica**: Move in front of front soldier, Dance of the Hawk to kill back 3.
 - **Millay**: Rush front guy from left, extra move 3 Left 1 Up.
 - **Seneca**: 1 Up 5 Right, Cyclone Force Bead tile below Millay.
 - *Enemy Archer moves left and places Mother Earth Bead.*
 - **Kika, Kyril, Corselia**: Forward Max. Have 1 Cyclone Force if Archer placed Earth tiles on us.

##### Turn 2
Treat movements more as recommendations. Final tile is what matters.

 - **Fast #2**: 1 Left 2 Back, Switch to Gary & buff Kyril & Fredrica. Move 2 Back. Standby rest of fight.
 - **Kika**: 2 Right. Cyclone Sword Soldier Right of Millay. 3 Up 1 Left.
 - Earth Soldier that didn't attack should attack Kyril from right now.
 - **Fredrica**: 3 Forward, Strong Shot Soldier 2 Left.
 - **Seneca**: 3 Forward 2 Right,  Strong Arm Soldier 3 behind. With LVL4 Weapon barely miss kill.
 - *Archer moves up and attacks Seneca here.*
 - **Corselia**: 5 Right, Flaming Arrows last Soldier if he's alive. If not, maybe Flaming Arrow Water Mage? She should always kill, might be a better fix than Seneca stats.
 - **Millay**: Rush Archer, move to center of Mother Earth panels. Face Forward. (Should be in range of officer only). Want to be below rock, 2 to the right.
 - **Simeon**: 3 Forward 2 Right, Breath of Ice all mages or the 2 non Water ones. Need to level up. If needed, use extra move for the movement. Just need to move at least 1 forward before Breath of Ice. He should be just out of range of Lightning enemies.
 - **Kyril**: 4 Right, kill Water mage. Extra move 2 Up, to where Simeon was.

##### Turn 3
 - **Fredrica**: 3 Forward 2 Left, onto closest Earth Tile. Strong Shot Officer.
 - **Kika**: 5 Up 1 Right (Order matters because of Cyclone Sword), Falcon Thrust Soldier.
 - **Seneca**: 5 Up, Cyclone Force Bead on Millay's tile (all Earth tiles).
 - **Millay**: 5 Right, Rush Spearman. Extra Move 5 left onto Wind Tile. Face up.
 - **Kyril**: 4 Up 2 Left (this seems incredible arbitrary, can probably be improved).
 - **Corselia**: 5 Up.
 - **Simeon**: 3 Forward, Silent Lake so you hit both mages. Extra move 1 Back 1 Left. Should also be adjusted.

##### Turn 4
 - **Fredrica**: Mount Owl, 8 Forward, switch to Andarc: Thunder Runner between 3 units.
 - **Seneca, Kyril, Corselia, Simeon**: Kill soldiers by Simeon.
 - **Kika**: 5 Forward 1 Right, Falcon Thrust Kangacorn Officer.
 - **Millay**: 1 Right 7 Forward, Rush Archer. Extra Move onto Wind Tile.

##### Turn 5
 - **Millay & Kika**: Finish 2 remaining mages.

#### Information
Both spawns are based off unit kills.

### Mido Plains (Martin Duel)
If he has a lvl3 skill point consider retrying, should be faster.
If he does Rage Sword LVL3 run to bottom right corner, Cyclone Sword T2. When he reaches you just move behind him and attack from back.
If he doesn't just move behind him and attack and move away. He should put down fire tiles, you move left and put Wind Tiles, he moves up and attacks, you attack him from back.

]}/>

#### Beads
 - Kyril: Flowing
 - Fast #1: Flowing Force Bead
 - Andarc: Thunder Force Bead
 - Fredrica: 3 Rage Force Beads
 - Millay: 2 Rage Force Beads

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Millay**: 9 Up.
 - **Fast #1**: Place Flowing Bead 1 Up 1 Right of Simeon. Extra move 9 Up.
 - **Simeon**: Start casting Breath of Ice. Should finish cast once 4 fish are close.
 - **Andarc**: Thunder Force Bead 2 left of self, so 3/4 fish are on Lightning Tiles.
 - If you only kill 3 fish survive, improvise. Simeon can extra move away for safety. Doesn't matter if Andarc dies.
 - **Kyril**: Cyclone Sword all 3 enemy soldiers. Extra move up a bit.
 - **Corselia**: 3 Down or so, Breath of Ice all 3 Soldiers, move 2 Up face down.

##### Turn 2
 - **Simeon/Andarc**: Kill damage other fish. After all fish are dead can kill Lino & Soldiers. Can switch Andarc for Kika or anyone else needed.
 - **Owls**: 9 Forward
 - **Kyril**: Flowing Force Bead so there's 1 tile before gate for Corselia.
 - **Corselia**: Move to Water Tile, Breath of Ice mages.

##### Turn 3
 - **Fast#1**: 7 Forward 2 Right, Switch to Fredrica. If needed for range/tile mount Owl, Attack mage, probably one on -tile.
 - **Millay**: 9 Forward, dismount.
 - **Kyril**: Can kill Ornela/Busk from now on.
 - **Corselia**: Hit mages if possible (make sure you have LVL3 MP left though). Chill on Water tile.

##### Turn 4
 - **Fredrica**: Mount Owl if not mounted already, move 8 up. Rage Force Bead 2 Up 2 Right (2 below middle fish). Extra Move 1 Left.
 - **Millay**: Kill last mage if still alive, move up as much as possible.

##### Turn 5
 - *Millay can tank a Shredding at full HP, and it doesn't matter if it kills Fredrica. So it's better to get him to do Shredding if possible so he doesn't place Wind tiles.*
 - **Fredrica**: 5 Up. Rage Force Bead 2 Up 2 Right (2 above left fish). Extra move 2 Up 1 Left.
 - **Millay**: Move where necessary, Rage Force Bead 1 Up 1 Right of Right Fish. Move away from fish if within 2 tiles. Don't get too close to Roget to not get shredding'd.
 - Roget is a dick, and will probably do something annoying here.
 - If he places more Wind Tiles, have Fredrica reapply. If Millay is before Fredrica, have her Standby. Then Fredrica puts down the tiles & stays in range of Shredding. Roget will Shredding, and Millay will get her turn before it goes off.

##### Turn 6
 - **Fredrica**: Place a Rage Force Bead if needed. Else standby somewhere near bottom left barricade.
 - **Millay**: Rush Roget from Wind Tile. Extra Move onto Wind Tile.
 - **Corselia & Simeon**: Blazing Wall if it would go off after Millay's turn. Else Standby and do it next turn.

##### Turn 7
 - Blazing Walls, Fredrica kill bottom left mage if he lives.

#### Information
Even if you kill the 3 fish and Roget at the same time, the rest will still spawn.

With current setup can use Fredrica w/ Owl and Corselia FA, which both have range of 4.
Use Seneca/Corselia first, since Fredrica can in theory perma-die.

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Millay**: 6 Up 1 Left, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1 Left 3 Up, face right.
 - **Ornela**: 7 Up 1 Right, Rush Blue Spearman. Extra move 1U1R face up or right
 - **Fast #2**: 9 Up (behind Red Swordsman), switch to Simeon. Silent Lake 1 Up 3 Left - Top left corner should be on top left staff wielder. Should hit fish and all staff wielders, and put Simeon on water. Face up.
 - **Fast #1**: 8 Up, switch Kika, Falcon Thrust Red Swordsman. Face up.
 - **Busk**: Standby to speed up next turn. Want to go after Big Fish before Kika.
 - **Kyril**: Move up and kill Yellow Bowman guy. If he hasn't moved yet can just move up for potential fish backup kill or standby to kill Yellow Bowman.

##### Turn 2
 - **Millay**: Move forward, Rush someone if in the way. Can move towards front left to avoid fish magic attack.
 - **Ornela**: Move up, Rush someone (not mage, not enough EXP gained) further along the way if in the way. Should level up. Use extra move to move up.
 - **Kika**: Kill Fish with Falcon LVL3
 - **Kyril**: Kill a unit / nothing. Backup for fish kill if Kika dies.

##### Turn 3
 - Ornela / Millay: move up, swap to Seneca / Fredrica / Corselia and kill eyes.

#### Beads
 - Ornela: Rage Force Bead
 - Millay: Mother Earth Bead
 - Kyril: Flowing Force Bead
 - Seneca or Kyril: Wind/Cyclone Force Bead

Fredrica needs LVL7 WPN, Power Gloves, Str. Sash
Seneca needs LVL7 WPN, Power Gloves, maybe STR Sash?
Need to figure out backup for Fredrica no LVL3. Simeon spells are too slow. Maybe with Gale Rune on him?

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
 - **Ornela**: 7 Down **DISMOUNT** (Even with back Red Soldiers). Rage Force Bead 2 Left (Center Red Soldier)
 - **Millay**: 9 Down 1 Right, Mother Earth Bead 2 Down (Bottom Left Spearman).
 - **Fast #1**: 8 Down 1 Right, Switch to Lino. Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Soldiers (should kill both).
 - **Fast #2**: Mount Owl, 9 Down. Switch to Fredrica, Dance of the Hawk. Should kill other 6 Soldiers.
 - **Seneca**: 4 Up, attack Chest for Ogre Breath. Extra Move 1 Right.
 - **Kyril**: 6 Up, Flowing Force Bead 1 Up.
 - *From this point on the bottom part of the fight is improvised. Progress slowly, don't over extend for single kills. Units can die with the exception of Millay, who can't permadie.*
 - **Busk & Trishtan**: Mount Kangacorn, move down. Swap to someone useful and do something useful.
 - Most useful units are Simeon & Kika. Simeon with +tile will kill pretty much anything. Breath of Ice doesn't have long cast time here because Busk/Trishtan are slow. Andarc can be used to place lightning tiles, Corselia can be used for damage w/ Explosion. Her other spells don't quite oneshot, but Explosion can with her +tile.

##### Turn 2
 - **Seneca**: 4 Up. Wind Force Bead on self / Cyclone Force Bead 1 Up. Or let Kyril do it.
 - **Kyril**: 1 Up, Wind / Cyclone Bead / Cyclone Sword if Seneca didn't.
 - Seneca & Kyril wait till units spawn at top. Seneca does Dance of the Hawk, should kill everything. If not Kyril helps deal with stragglers.

#### Information.

### Iskas
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Kyril', x: 0, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Slow Char.', x: 0, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Fast #1 (RO)', x: 4, y: 0 },
  { name: 'Fast #2 (WO)', x: 4, y: 1 },
]}/>

Andarc & Corselia are good candidates for Slow Char.

#### Strategy
General strategy is fast people rush bottom, Kyril hides in corner & Simeon kills enemies to protect Kyril.
When you kill 8 enemies more spawn, careful to not spawn more too early.

##### Turn 1
 - **Fast #1**: 9 Down 1 Right, **Dismount**.
 - **Fast #2**: 10 Down, **Dismount**.
 - **Slow Char**: Switch to Simeon, move 5 Right or 1 Down 4 Right, Breath of Ice or Explosion. Make sure you kill Wind Mage on bottom part. Extra move back to furthest Water tile.
 - **Kyril**: Flowing Force Bead 1 Down 3 Right. Move into bottom corner.

##### Turn 2
 - **Fast #1**: 1 Down 4 Right (out of range of cannon.)
 - **Fast #2**: Mount Armored Kangacorn, forward max.
 - **Kyril**: Try to kill someone, preferably with Cyclone Sword.
 - **Simeon**: More nuking, watch out for cast time & turn order. Generally can Breath of Ice if did Breath last turn, Flaming Arrows if did Explosion.
 - Kyril and Simeon just kill stuff and hide from now on. Kyril can Swallow LVL3 people.

##### Turn 3
 - **Fast #1**: Forward max (x2?)
 - **Fast #2**: Forward **9**, switch to Millay. Mount **Red Owl**, **Giant Owl LVL2.**
 - *Fast #1 moving 9 forward here shoud manipulate Iskas to move 3L1D or 2L2D. As long as he doesn't move into corner you can hit from back anyway.*

##### Turn 4
 - **Fast #1**: Move towards Iskas, Mother Earth Bead him.
 - **Millay**: Move behind Iskas, dismount, and attack to kill.

#### Information
Every point of SKL = 1% more accuracy vs Iskas (and probably in general).
Bottom Right Chest Guardian Vestment
Left Chest Hero's Armor
More units spawn after killing a certain amount
Iskas is Lightning Element
Units keep Spawning 1 by one even after second phase
Rune Cannons inflict random statuses

### Fishskas
#### Setup
<PartyFormation formation={[
  { name: 'Fast #1 (RO)', x: 2, y: 1 },
  { name: 'Millay / Fast #2', x: 2, y: 2 },
  { name: 'Ornela (K)', x: 2, y: 3 },
]}/>

Make sure if starting Fast #2 that Millay is not in formation, so you can switch to her.
Millay / Fast #2 needs to be 3rd fastest, and needs to be slower than Evil Fish. Aim for low 50's speed.

##### Strategy
 - Ornela: Rush bottom Red Fish.
 - Fast #1: Mother Earth Bead under Fishskas, so Millay will have an Earth tile to attack from too.
 - Fast #2 / Millay: Swap to Millay & Mount, Forward 10 and Rush Fishskas.

#### Information
Every 1 STR on Kika is about 10 damage.

### Evil Eye
##### Equipment
 - Kyril: Ogre Breath

##### Information
 - Evil Eye has 2 damage gates, at 33% & 66%. After each one it will back away and start charging. First unlocks it's column attack. After 2nd charge it does the big nuke.
 - It does physical damage with its bunch of beams attack.

##### Strategy
 1. 1 Forward, Cyclone Force 4 Forward
 2. 3 Forward, Swallow LVL3. Extra move 1 more forward, to center Wind tile. Eye should move away now.
 3. Standby / Cyclone Force if you didn't level T2.
 4. Move behind it, Swallow LVL3 for kill.

Final Textbox is Corsela ""Kyril... Kyril!!"

## General Information
#### Counterattack
Can counter when hit
Probability reduced by enemy Bull's Eye.
25%/50% penalty to counter attack & avoidance when hit from side/back.
Can reduce penalty with Mind's Eye.

#### Mounts
Kangacorns: +3 MOV, JMP = 1
Normal kangacorn: +50% STR, +10% SPD... -30% EVA
Armored Kangacorn: +50% STR, +30% PDF... -30% EVA
Useable by 1h sword, spear and missile weapon users.

Owls: +2 MOV, JMP = 4 (dunno if that has any effect for the owls)
Red/Blue Giant Owl: +30% STR, +30% EVA, +30% SPD... -30% PDF
White Giant Owl (Armored): +30% STR, +30% EVA... -10% PDF
Useable by 1h sword, spear, and most archers (not Seneca). Archers have their range increased by 1 while on an owl.

#### Coops
kfcrispy: i don't know the coop damage formula, but they definitely don't use Battle Lust. perhaps they use raw stats (affected by terrain) and the base power like a spell

Can maybe test via editing stats.
+ATK (Seared Bonito) doesn't increase damage
Enemy Tile very slightly affects damage? (Went from 123 to 130 in test, going from positive to neutral)
Positive tile for allies slightly affects damage (Neutral tile Kyril 123, pos tile Kyril 133)

#### Items
Puffered Fish Sashimi doesn't raise M.ATK?

#### Firefly
If Enemies can't hit Eugene normally, but can hurt him by placing tiles they will place tiles.

#### Current Ideas
Skip Eugene, get Maxine & Pablo
Maybe spec Flare a bit, Maxine and Flare will be used for El-Eal > Calleron Laboratory.
Considering specing out Akaghi a little bit too for both El-Eal battles and Callonbal 1.
Keep Thunder God Garb on Seneca, at least until after Caleron Lab. She's mostly with Andarc up to that point.

Post Obel can do sharpen / shop in Illuya instead of Nay.
Benefits:
 * Has Rune Shop, early Gale potentially
 * Potential tier 2 beads in bargains
 * Crab Bun
Downsides:
 * No Seared Bonito

#### Ranking
http://suikosource.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5022&sid=6a16db4f67d1fabdf82b6b494eeb3511&start=45#p155223
##### Criteria explanation
Turn amount: number of actions made regardless of foe or friend (!!!)
Total damage: The total damage all allies (excluding NPCs) received
Damage rate: The average damage dealt to enemies from attacks (including runes)
Positive element count: The number of times your allies (excluding NPCs) end a turn on positive element
Total value of received experience: self-explaining

##### Numeric values to determine the rank
STEP1 Determining the rank for each criteria
• Turn amount & total damage
S: base value +0%
A: base value +30%
B: base value +80%
C: above
• Damage rate & positive element count & total experience value
S: base value -0%
A: base value -30%
B: base value -80%
C: below
- Each stage has different base values (?) [Look at the sheet that KFCrispy shared some posts ago]
- [I don’t understand the first sentence] A missed attack is counted as an attack that did 0 damage
- [Not sure but it seems…] The base value for experience is 500 per enemy.
STEP2 For each of the 5 criteria you’ll get a score depending on the rank you achieved in each criteria
S: 0 A: 10 B: 30 C: 60
STEP3 These scores are used to calculate an average score that will finally determine the stage rank
S: less than 5 A: less than 13 B: less than 31 C: 31 or more
[-> it means you can A rank in 2 criteria as long as you S rank the remaining 3, because you would get 10+10+0+0+0=10 -> 20/5=4 -> S rank! If you B rank in any criteria there's no chance of getting stage rank S!]

#### Eugene days
Based off day in Obel.

Water Day: Move to Illuya, then Na-Nal
Wind Day: Na-Nal, Illuya, Na-Nal
Lightning: Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Fire: Illuya, Na-Nal, Nay, Na-Nal
Earth: Na-Nal

#### Legacy Graska 2
#### Setup
Backline formation doesn't matter except Kyril.
Middle front should be slower of Jewel / Paula.
Assuming Jewel is faster, adjust accordingly.
Speedwise ideally it's Ornela, Fredrica/Millay, Jewel, Paula.
Can adjust with mounts and/or Godspeed Anklets.
Want Paula to be 39SPD or more.
Ornela & Millay on Kangacorns.

##### Requirements
Fredrica: Rage/Fire Bead
Millay: Earth/Mother Earth Bead
Ornela: Cyclone Force Bead

Formation

Busk Kyril Simeon -
Millay Fredrica Paula Jewel Ornela

#### Strategy
##### Turn 1
Ornela: 7D (Even with back Red Soldiers)b, Cyclone Force Bead. Ideally on front guy in second group, but if Earth/Fire already set tile in front of Ornela works. Important part is to get Wind tile infront of front Blue Spearman.
Millay: 9D1R, Earth Force Bead middle spearman / Mother Earth Force tile below middle spearman.
Fredrica: Mount if not mounted, move next to front red swordsman and Fire Tile middle / Rage tile front.
Jewel: 8D1L, behind back red swordsman. Swap to Lino & Unicorn LVL2 2 Blue Spearman.
Paula: 9D, swap to Seneca and Hawk LVL3. Should kill 6. Ideally front 8 are dead here.

Simeon: move up and Breath of Ice Ogre Breath (Left Chest)
Busk: move up
Kyril: move down

##### Turn 2
Simeon: Flowing Force Bead center column, 3 north of chest. Can move cursor to chest, move left to middle, then up 3.
Busk: move up (not into water).
Fredrica: move down, swap to Kika and kill something.
Rest: keep moving down and killing stuff. Be careful with Millay. Unit deaths don't matter but permadeath does.

##### Turn 3 & on.
Simeon move into front water tile.
When top soldiers spawn Breath of Ice middle 2. Busk gets on owl and kills right one.
Rest keep doing same thing.
