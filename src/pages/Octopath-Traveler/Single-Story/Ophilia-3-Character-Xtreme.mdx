#### Mystery Man & Shady Figure (28172/32197HP)
You need an Inhibit by T3 or you lose.
There are backups, will describe below.

##### Turn 1
 - Ophilia: Summon
 - Cyrus: Spearhead MM
 - Tressa: HHB x2 / HHB

##### Turn 2
 - Cyrus: Spear x3 MM
 - Ophilia: Defend
 - Tressa: Pom M Self / Nothing / L Stone for safety strat.

##### Turn 3
 - Ophilia: HHDx4 / HHMx4 if you needed to restore reputation
 - Cyrus: L Stone
 - Tressa: HHV x4

##### Turn 4 (If you needed to restore reputation)
 - Merchant 1: Collect
 - Other: M Stone (After Collect)

> If you have extra resources, you can skip the boost / Pom M with Tressa and throw an L Stone T2.
Then T3 use Dancers instead of Mercs, and T4 throw an L and an M. This wins without Inhibit.

> Jankier backup is to play as normal, with Dancers T3. From what I've seen, MM should do Arcane Blade T4 killing someone. You then finish with 2 L Stones and leave 1 person dead. That person probably won't survive Consuming Darkness and maybe even Black Gale anymore.

> There's also a no Inhibit strat with 3Ls but it requires Cyrus not missing, which is unreliable unless you buy Unerring Bracelet.

At this point you need to have 1L 1M Stones minimum. You can get backups in Rippletide.

TP **Noblecourt**, head to **Whispermill**.

Break Plains Drake battle with Thousand Spears and Merchant Spear Attacks. Then Flee.

<Menu>

> Do this menu before Drakes if Cyrus doesn't have Thousand Spears, after if he does.

##### Jobs

 - Ophilia: Reflective Veil, **Warrior**, First 2 Skills or anything + Thousand Spears if before Drakes.

##### Equip Skills

Pick **Cat's Eye**.

### Chapter 4
Pick **Thunder M**.

<Menu>

##### Buy
 - 1 Grape M

> You want to have at least 1 Grape M, 2 Grape Bunches. Extras are nice though.

##### Sell
 - Everything till $88500

</Menu>

S&Q in second screen. Pick **$30000**.

#### Cultists
Break with HHM x4, kill with 1 L Stone + 2 M Stone

#### Mattias 97686HP
> Typically you need 3 Max Vets with Inhibit, 1 3x Vets with Inhibit, and 1 Reflective Veil. Can make do with less if you have Stones. Typically, 1L 1M Stone makes up the damage from 1 HHVx4 without Inhibit.

> YOU WILL ALMOST ALWAYS NEED 2 Inhibits for this fight. Good fights are 5/6T, can extend to 9. After 9 he summons adds and you can't win.

> Figuring out variations are an exercise left to the reader. I'm just going to put a standard fight up to T5.
> There are bonus strats available if you have someone before Mattias T2. Typically you heal someone with Grape M T1. Then Ophilia can afford to Defend T2 instead of Reflective, which gives you a chance to get Inhibit at the start of T3. > Start of T3 Inhibit is the most optimal Inhibit, can do fight with only 1 Inhibit.

##### Turn 1
 - Ophilia: Summon
 - Cyrus: Blizzard
 - Tressa: Defend

##### Turn 2
 - Tressa: HHM x2
 - Cyrus: Pom L Tressa
 - Ophilia: Reflective Veil character that got hit (If you had a free turn and were able to Grape M with Tressa instead of Defend, can Defend here)

##### Turn 3
 - Ophilia: Reflective Veil other character that got hit (Inhibit hits)
 - Cyrus: HHV x4
 - Tressa: HHV x4

> Assuming 2 Inhibit, or T3 Inhibit

##### Turn 4
 - Ophilia: Defend
 - Cyrus: Blizzard
 - Tressa: Donate BP / Pom Cyrus

##### Turn 5
 - Ophilia: Sword x4
 - Cyrus: HHV x3
 - Tressa: HHV x4

If you don't have Inhibit, replace Vets with Healing Grape Bunches. Break T7, and repeat hopefully with Inhibit. If you don't have extra Stones, you can't win if you don't get a set of Vets of with Inhibit by the end of T6.

The tricky part of the fight is handling Worrywart leaving around T3-T4. Once again, will be left exercise for the runner.

2 Cutscene then GG!
