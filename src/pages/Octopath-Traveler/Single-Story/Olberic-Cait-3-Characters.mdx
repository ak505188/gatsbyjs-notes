> If you were paying attention, you might be wondering why we bought the Bottle of Blinding Dust

> This fight isn't completely scripted, I'll be listing a rough script along with goals for each break.
> To heal Olberic a Grape M or Grape Bunch works.

> The big thing to look for is getting Therion 5BP before his action T4. T3 Therion last into T4 Therion 1st really sucks.
> You can delay T3 Leghold to T4 to guarantee it. That + 2BP on Tressa more or less guarantees win.
