## Therion 3 Character Notes

### Preface
This route is a 3 character route for Therion.
The route is generally straightforward - Orlick and Gareth are relatively scripted as long as Therion goes before the merchants on the first turn and does not die.
You have ~16,000 to use on the 3% steal rests in Chapter 4 before needing to reload your save.
Darius is scripted past T1 - you need to break him before his turn and you will win.

### Chapter 1
Proceed through the cutscenes.

Steal all 4 soulstones **Fire, Ice, Wind, Shadow** from the merchant on your left.

When you end up at Ravus Manor, do the cutscene, then loot the purple chest for **Iron Helm**.

After downstairs scene, before stealing from the man, go to the weapon shop.

Buy an **Arcane Knife**, optimize Therion in equipment menu (equips both Arcane Knife and Iron Helm)

Run/Break all encounters as you make your way through Ravus Manor.

#### Heathcote
You may need healing sometimes if you have a bad turn order (if you heal, it's probably on T3-T4).
Other than that, the fight is primarily scripted.

T1-T4: Throw all 4 soulstones (They will always be at the bottom of your item menu).
T5: Wildfire x4
T6: Wildfire
T7: Wildfire x4

Head over to the Quarrycrest area.
Save at the save point (you may want to walk a little bit there if you want to be safe), and throw yourself at the encounter.

Whether or not you die and reload, or escape, head over to Derelict Mine, get the **Wind L** and teleport back to Boulderfall.

Make your way to Atlasdam, breaking and/or fleeing from encounters on the way.
If you find a cait, kill it with the Wind L, and press the cait button to see the route, which diverges from the noncait route.

<Cait>

Get Scholar shrine (Flee from the encounter if you get it before scholar shrine - good luck!)

### Therion Ch.2 Pt.2
Optionally, Scrutinize the lady at the entrance for Thunder L. If you lose reputation, restore it at the Tavern after the cutscene.
 - If you are close to losing reputation after getting the Scrutinize, you can consider going for Thieving Tips & Tricks and Curious Antique
Scrutinizes now so you can restore reputation along the way. 

Continue the story, up until you go to the Tavern. If you need to, restore reputation.
If you didn't get the Thunder L, TP **Rippletide** and Scrutinize Tony's Mom for one.

At the Northreach area, head into Maw of the Ice Dragon, loot the **$30000** chest and head out.

You'll get 2x Lizards on the way to Northreach.
Break them with HHB x2, then use a Thunder L to kill.
Use Therion's Incite if he is first as needed.

> Sometimes you win this battle with people dead at the end. You might need to make some adjustments.
> Therion: Nourishing S + Iron Helm lets him survive Darius. GL with Ch.3 8%s :)
> Cyrus: With Cait route no Blizzard for Orlick?
> Tressa: Needs Nourish S + Defend to survive crit.

<Menu>

##### Learn Skills
 * Therion: <Cait>**Armor Corrosive**</Cait><NoCait>Thousand Spears</NoCait>

Heal Therion to full.

</Menu>

#### Orlick

<NoCait>

There is a chance Therion or someone can die on T3 if you get unlucky with Magic Missile. If so, olive the dead person and repeat T3/T4 (breaking Orlick) as needed.


##### Turn 1
 * Therion: Incite
 * Cyrus: Blizzard
 * Tressa: HHM x2 

##### Turn 2
 * Therion: AC x2
 * Tressa: Shadow L

##### Turn 4
 * Tressa/Cyrus: HHV x3

</Cait>

### Chapter 3
Proceed through the story and do the steals.
When you steal from the tavern person, you'll have infinite tries.

For the encounter before Gareth, kill them using Light M + HHB or Light S.

Heal Therion as needed, and begin the fight with Gareth.

#### Gareth

This fight is scripted, except if Therion dies to crit slices (not posssible with a cait), or if Therion is not first and his adds kill someone before Therion can use Incite.

##### Turn 1
 * Therion: Incite
 * Cyrus: Blizzard
 * Tressa: Defend

##### Turn 2
 * Tressa: HHV x3
 * Therion: Armor Corrosive
 * Cyrus: Defend

If Therion dies before his action on T2, you'll need Cyrus to Olive and hope Therion is before him.
If not, you'll need to throw a Soulstone M to make up the damage.
If he revives after Cyrus, you'll need to throw 2 L Stones to make up the damage. It's also a range, might need a bit more.

##### Turn 3
 * Cyrus: HHV x4
 * Therion: HP Thief x4

### Chapter 4
After the cutscene, get **Master's Longbow**. Heal Therion if needed before the forced encounter.

Kill the forced encounter here.
Use Therion's Incite if he is first, and have both merchants use HHM x2 to break.
Use 1L 1M or 3M to kill the encounter.

Proceed through the cutscenes.
Before attempting the 3%, head to the NPC near the provisioner shop.

Steal the **Fool's Gold Ore**, Scrutinize him (you'll pick it up later at the tavern), and purchase the **Curious Antique**.

Afterwards, trigger the 3% cutscene and do the steal.
Each reputation restore costs 1k, and assuming you did no reputation resets, you'll have roughly 15k worth of resets you can do before having to reload.
Good luck!

Afterwards, perform the following menu:

<Menu>

##### Equipment
Therion: Unequip (If you got 3% within 5-10 tries, you can keep Viper Dagger on him), Empowering Ring (SKIP THIS if Therion has cait XP at any point)

##### Jobs
Cyrus: Warrior + 2 Skills, back to Merchant
Therion: Shackle Foe, Warrior (+ Thousand Spears if needed)

Heal everyone to full, proceed through the dungeon (Get the Ice M chest before entering the Cathedral if you don't have any M stones), and save before Darius.

#### Darius
You need to break him before he gets his action.
Afterwards, the fight is scripted (unless you have the second scenario below and you're not on Cait Route).
