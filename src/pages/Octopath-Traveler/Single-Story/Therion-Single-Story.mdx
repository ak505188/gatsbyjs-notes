## Therion 3 Character Notes

### Preface
This route is a 3 character route for Therion.
The route is generally straightforward - Orlick and Gareth are relatively easy as long as Therion goes before the merchants on the first turn.
You will have ~16,000 to use on the 3% steal rests in Chapter 4 before needing to reload your save.
Darius is scripted past T1 - you need to break him before his turn and you will win.

### Chapter 1
Proceed through the cutscenes.

Steal all 4 soulstones **Fire, Ice, Wind, Shadow** from the merchant on the left.

When you end up at Ravus Manor, do the cutscene, then loot the purple chest for **Iron Helm**.

After downstairs scene, before stealing from the man, go to the weapon shop.

Buy an **Arcane Knife**, optimize Therion in equipment menu (equips both Arcane Knife and Iron Helm)

Run/Break all encounters as you make your way through Ravus Manor.

#### Heathcote
You may need healing sometimes if you have a bad turn order (if you heal, it's probably on T3-T4.
Other than that, the fight is primarily scripted.

T1-T4: Throw all 4 soulstones (They will always be at the bottom of your item menu).
T5: Wildfire x4
T6: Wildfire
T7: Wildfire x4

Head over to the Quarrycrest area.
Save at the save point (you may want to walk a little bit there if you want to be safe), and throw yourself at the encounter.

Whether or not you die and reload, or escape, head over to Derelict Mine, get the **Wind L** and teleport back to Boulderfall.

Make your way to Atlasdam, breaking and/or fleeing from encounters on the way.
If you find a cait, kill it with the Wind L, and press the cait button to see the route.

Steal the **Fool's Gold Ore**, Scrutinize him (you'll pick it up later at the tavern), and purchase the **Curious Antique**.

Afterwards, trigger the 3% cutscene and do the steal.
