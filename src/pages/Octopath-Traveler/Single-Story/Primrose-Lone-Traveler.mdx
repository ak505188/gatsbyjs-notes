<SEO title="Octopath Traveler Primrose Lone Traveler Speedrun" />

### Primrose Chapter 1
Buy __Arcane Knife__, Allure __Elderly Woman__. Pick __Shadow Stone__.

You can choose to kill whatever battles you want between here & **Scholar Shrine**. You want 94JP before going to Scholar Shrine minimum.

#### Helgenish
T1: Shadow Soulstone
T2: Summon
T3+: Dagger (Break)
T4+: BPx4 Moonlight Waltz
T5+: BPx3 Moonlight Waltz

You can choose to pick **Old Coin** and/or do Kit quest. Each of these give an extra restore reputation in **Cobbleston**.

Go to **Cobbleston**.

### Cobbleston
Sell Gold Items, optionally buy Healing Grapes. You want to have a multiple of $2000 left.

Allure girl by Tavern (10%). Restore reputation costs $2000.
Head to **Scholar Shrine**.

If you see a Cait, kill it with Summon and skip Whistlewood.
You can use Summon to kill smaller battles, but you need 2-3 for Whistlewood & Scholar Shrine. I also like to save charges to go for YOLO Everhold area battle levelups.

Go to Whistlewood, kill a battle (or 2) with Summon. You want to have 94JP before going to **Scholar Shrine**.

Kill Scholar Shrine battle with Summon, get Scholar.

<Menu>

Learn 2 Scholar skills, preferably Fire Storm for Stonegard battle, and Evasive Maneuvers.

</Menu>

Tag **Noblecourt**, head to **Forest of Purgation**.

### Forest of Purgation
Pick **Light L** and **$20000**.
TP **Cobbleston** and head to **Stonegard**.

Tag **Stonegard**, go to **Moonstruck Coast**.

Save at the save point, then optionally reload and get **Merchant Shrine**.
If you have <30JP, you can take the battle here and kill it with **Light L**.

<Menu>

**Merchant**, Hired Help

Learn Sidestep and Endless Items as soon as you have enough JP.

</Menu>

Tag **Goldshore**, head to **West Grandport Coast**.

Pick **Wind L**, reset screen, pick **$20000**, S&Q at the savepoint.
Pick **Thunder L**, tag **Grandport**, and go to **Loch of the Lost King**.

### Loch of the Lost King
I recommend picking the **Pom L** here and leaving to reset the screen. You want to have at least 4 Pom L for Ch.3 and 4, and having more definitely helps.

Pick **Wind L** and **$30000**. TP **Grandport**.

### Grandport
Buy **Knight Shield** from Weapon/Armor shop.
On next screen pick **Silver-filled Pouch.**
On the next screen, get **$25000 + Artwork**, TP to **Goldshore** and head to **Captain's Bane**.

### Captain's Bane
Like Loch, I recommend picking the **Pom L** here and leaving to reset the screen.
Pick **Articulate Stone**, TP **Stonegard** and head to **West Everhold Pass**.

### West Everhold Pass
Pick **Light L** and **Silver-filled Pouch**. Save at the save point.
Whether or not you reload here is up to you. I like to just run to wherever I'm going and try to get a Flurry on the battle. If you get a Flurry, kill with an L Stone.

Tag **Everhold**, head to **Everhold Tunnels**. Use same logic for save as before.

### Everhold Tunnels
Pick **Pom L**. Reset steps & pick **$35000**. Buffer glitch and pick **Bright Stone**. Pick **Death Cleaver**, and TP **Everhold**.

Head to **Shrine of the Runeblade**, same rules as before. Pick **$50000**.

TP **Stonegard**.

### Stonegard
Go to right screen. You can buy **11 Grape Ms** here or any other shop that has them later on.
Allure **Patrician Youth (35%)** standing to the left of the church. Go to top screen and talk to guy by fountain with quest to get **Royal Crest**.

If you haven't done Everhold stuff yet, you can Allure the Hunter to the right to have someone with Flurry.

TP **Sunshade** and get **Apothecary Shrine**.

From here you can TP to either **Sunshade** or **Stonegard** and head to **Marsalim Catacombs**. It's 3s faster from **Stonegard**, feel like that path is safer too but I'm not sure.

Pick **Thunder L** on the way to Catacombs.

### Marsalim Catacombs
Buffer glitch to get **Master Spear**. Pick **Revitalizing Jam**, reset steps, and run out of Catacombs.
Go to **Marsalim**

### Marsalim
Go to Palace, pick **Enchanted Circlet, $25,000, High House Armor** in the three red chests in the room to the far right.

<Menu>

##### Equipment
Optimize, Royal Crest, Bright Stone

</Menu>

TP **Noblecourt** and run to **Stillsnow**.

On screen before **Stillsnow**, you can choose to reset at Tomb of the Imperator or YOLO. If you get the battle kill with Thunder L.

### Stillsnow
Start Primrose Ch.2. After Alluring the Tavernkeeper and talking to Oren, run out towards **Northreach**.

### Northreach & Grind
We're going to use Northreach Lizards to grind EXP/JP. You want to have 430JP before Prim Ch.2.
We kill all Lizards with Bandits x2 + L Stone.
Ideally, you have 2 L Stones left after Grind. 1 for Rufus, 1 for Simeon 1.

Go to **Maw of the Ice Dragon**. You can remove **Evasive Maneuvers** to get a Lizard fight before Maw.

In Maw pick **$30000** and run out. Run to Northreach. If at Northreach you still need to grind remove Evasive Maneuvers and run back out. After getting a battle TP back to Northreach and run back out until you're done grinding.

TP **Northreach** and put Evasive Maneuvers back on.

Buffer glitch into **Lorn Cathedral**.

### Lorn Cathedral
> There's a **Ice L** in the bottom right corner of the first screen if you really need an L Stone.

Go to second screen. Pick **Pom L** and reset screen. Go down path until steps go up. Follow those + the hidden path to the end and pick **Void Amulet**.

TP **Noblecourt**.
Go to second screen and Allure **Luckless Sellsword (24%)**

TP **Stillsnow** and continue Chapter 2.

#### Rufus 30358HP
 1. Summon
 2. HHB x3
 3. L Stone
 4. Sidestep if before Rufus (he does Pummel this turn which knocks you unconscious.)

T5 & on attack with Spear & wait for Full Enfeeblement. Once Full Enfeeblement break and kill with HHVx4
If Luckless sellsword got a lot of hits in you might not even need Full Enfeeblement.

TP **Noblecourt**.

<Menu>

Teach **Hale & Hearty**, switch back to **Merchant**.
After equipping H&H heal with a grape.

</Menu>

### Obsidian Manse
Pick **$5000**. S&Q on screen transition. Pick **Silver-filled Pouch**. I recommend saving.

#### Albus 52599HP
 1. HHM
 2. HHM x3
 3. Summon / Rev Jam if Albus first T4
 4. Summon / Rev Jam

After this, focus on staying healthy and keeping BP up. Knock off shields when you have a chance.
As soon as Luckless Sellsword does Full Enfeeblement, break with HHVx4 and do HHVx3. Then last turn do HHVx1 if Enfeeblement is up, else Defend > HHVx2.
You can do this fight with 2 Vets if you have some extra damage from Luckless Sellsword or knock off more shields before breaking, but you have money for an extra HHV anyway so might as well use it.

### Noblecourt
Dismiss Luckless Sellsword, and go Allure him again. You want to refresh his charges.

TP **Everhold**.

### Everhold
Pick **Rare Stone**.

Enter Ampitheatre, pick **Fire L** and **$30000**. TP **Everhold**.

Go to shop, sell all gold items, Master Spear, and Death Cleaver. You should have at least $236000.

Go back to Ampitheatre. Pick **$20000**, can choose to S&Q at screen transition.

Pick **Light L**. Pick **Revitalizing Jam**. Pick **Pom L**. I recommend saving.

> You want the 2 L Stones from here, 1 other L Stone, 1 Rev Jam, and at least 2 Pom Ls going into this fight.
> You have 3 Vets available for Simeon 1 and 5 for Simeon 2.

### Simeon 1 64300HP Father Marionette 24483HP Dancer Marionette 19785HP
> You're not guaranteed to survive T1/2, but should most of the time at LVL19/20.

 1. Defend / Sidestep if before Puppets T2.
 2. Sidestep x3
 3. Revitalizing Jam
 4. Sidestep x4
 5. Light L
 6. Sidestep x4
 7. Pom L
 8. Bandits x3
 9. Fire L **(Delay this if there is a Def buff on Male Puppet. Ideally there isn't one on anyone but that's the only one that breaks the setup. Stall turns with Sidesteps).**
10. HHV x4
11. L Stone (If Simeon was after Vets, he'll buff Male Puppet. This will actually make him go last this turn, even though he was coming out of break.)

From here on out, just Summon, break + Full Enfeeblement and use Vets. You can mitigate Simeons attacks with Sidesteps or just healing. You have 2 Vets available for this. If possible preserve charges for Simeon 2.

### Simeon 2
> Simeon does 1 Physical attack every turn in his starting pattern. Use that to count how many sidesteps you need.

 1. Sidestep
 2. Sidestep x3
 3. Pom L
 4. Sidestep x4
 5. Attack
 6. Sidestep x4

From here, get his shields low with attacks and get BP back up. Make sure you maintain sidesteps as well.
When he's down to a few shields, Summon. And when you get Full Enfeeblement, Break and HHVx4. Keep Sidesteps up while waiting for Enfeeblement, you can boost up to 3x if you have max BP

Phase 2 is the trickiest. You want to knock off some shields here with HHV without putting him below half HP. He switches patterns at below half, and will eat through Sidesteps like crazy. You want to HHV early, then get shields down to 1 with HHM, then once you get Full Enfeeblement and are full BP break with HHVx4 and follow with HHVx3. You also want to have at least 1 Sidestep or enough HP to tank an attack going into next phase.

After the second break you just Pom M and HHVx4. He should only get 1 attack in here max, due to him switching phases.


GG!
