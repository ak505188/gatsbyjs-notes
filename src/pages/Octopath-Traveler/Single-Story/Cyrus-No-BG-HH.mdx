Save before Yvon.

Yvon
This is basically pray for no Tornado or double tap. By far worst part of the run. Good luck :)
T1 you want to increase def / shackle Yvon. HHM is best. Based off who goes first. Unless you know no one will die you want to break T2.

T1
Cyrus: LB / Defend / Leghold Yvon
Tressa/Prim: HHM / HHB x2 / Defend
Therion: Shackle Yvon / Defend

T2 & 3
Break Yvon + Adds, throw 3 L Stones.
If possible boost Corrosive T3 (can Pom S to setup).
You'll have dead turns here almost always.
You can recover a character dying T1 if they already had their action.

Cyrus: Staff x4
Tressa: Defend
Therion: Corrosive / Attack
Prim: Attack / Defend

T5

Prim & Therion before Lucia (can adjust this to be more like Prim OR Therion). Probably don't boost HHM T1 & do another HHM T2.
Benefit would be less likely to need Summon. Downside would be more risk of crit messing things up.
