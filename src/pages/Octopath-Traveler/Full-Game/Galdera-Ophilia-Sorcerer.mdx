> This turn is kind of hard to explain, so I'll just list the goals of the turn.
>
> 1. Get Leghold up. This can be done through Leghold or Injurious Dust + Curious Bloom, which also breaks a shield.
> 2. Heal / prevent status. Anyone can heal with Herb of Clarity, Alfyn can prevent with Soothing dust + Curious bloom.
> 3. Set up turn 2 Aelfics. You need to Pom Therion & defend with him if he's before Ophilia. Worst case, you can Soothing Seed + Curious Bloom Therion to put him before Cyrus.
> 4. Break 1 shield off Steorra. Can be done with any character that has a free turn. This can also be done next turn.
>
> Despite all this text, this fight is pretty easy. You generally have multiple free turns. Just need to get a feel for it.

##### Turn 1

> You need someone between Ophilia T4 and T5 to give him 1 BP. Should always be possible with 4 & 8 shields, and possible most of the time with 12 shields.
> If you need to use Revitilizing Jam, try to use it with Therion.
> If you get 12S, someone needs to be able to give Ophilia 1BP between his turns T4 and T5. If not, you need an extra 2 L Stones + Amputation to kill. In this case, you might just want to have Tressa Leghold T4, finish break T5, and finish T6 with a Holy Light or something.
