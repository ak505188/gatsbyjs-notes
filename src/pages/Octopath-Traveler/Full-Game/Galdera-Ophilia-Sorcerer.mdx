>

> 2. Heal / prevent status. Anyone can heal with Herb of Clarity, Alfyn can prevent with Soothing dust + Curious bloom.
> 3. Set up turn 2 Aelfics. You need to Pom Therion & defend with him if he's before Ophilia. Worst case, you can Soothing Seed + Curious Bloom Therion to put him before Cyrus.
> 4. Break 1 shield off Steorra. Can be done with any character that has a free turn. This can also be done next turn.
>
> Despite all this text, this fight is pretty easy. You generally have multiple free turns. Just need to get a feel for it.

##### Turn 1
 * Ophilia: Heal status / Pom S Therion / Fire/Ice/Thunder M / Ignis
 * Tressa: Heal status / Leghold / Donate BP Therion
 * Therion: Defend / Heal status / Pom S self

> Fight changes depending on amount of shield on Steorra. 4S is free, 8S is slightly harder, 12S is the worst one.
> You need someone between Ophilia T4 and T5 to give him 1 BP. Should always be possible with 4 & 8 shields, and possible most of the time with 12 shields.
> If you need to use Revitilizing Jam, try to use it with Therion.
> If you get 12S, someone needs to be able to give Ophilia 1BP between his turns T4 and T5. If not, you need an extra 2 L Stones + Amputation to kill. In this case, you might just want to have Tressa Leghold T4, finish break T5, and finish T6 with a Lightning Blast or something.
